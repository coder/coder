[Coder](https://coder.com) enables organizations to set up development environments in their public or private cloud infrastructure. Cloud development environments are defined with Terraform, connected through a secure high-speed WireguardÂ® tunnel, and are automatically shut down when not in use to save on costs. Coder gives engineering teams the flexibility to use the cloud for workloads that are most beneficial to them.

- Define cloud development environments in Terraform
  - EC2 VMs, Kubernetes Pods, Docker Containers, etc.
- Automatically shutdown idle resources to save on costs
- Onboard developers in seconds instead of days

## Quickstart

The most convenient way to try Coder is to install it on your local machine and experiment with provisioning cloud development environments using Docker (works on Linux, macOS, and Windows).

```
# First, install Coder
curl -L https://coder.com/install.sh | sh

# Start the Coder server (caches data in ~/.cache/coder)
coder server

# Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to create your initial user
# Create a Docker template, and provision a workspace
```

## Install

The easiest way to install Coder is to use our
[install script](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/install.sh) for Linux
and macOS. For Windows, use the latest `..._installer.exe` file from GitHub
Releases.

```bash
curl -L https://coder.com/install.sh | sh
```

You can run the install script with `--dry-run` to see the commands that will be used to install without executing them. You can modify the installation process by including flags. Run the install script with `--help` for reference.

> See [install](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/install) for additional methods.

Once installed, you can start a production deployment<sup>1</sup> with a single command:

```shell
# Automatically sets up an external access URL on *.try.coder.app
coder server

# Requires a PostgreSQL instance (version 13 or higher) and external access URL
coder server --postgres-url <url> --access-url <url>
```

> <sup>1</sup> For production deployments, set up an external PostgreSQL instance for reliability.

Use `coder --help` to get a list of flags and environment variables. Use our [install guides](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/install) for a full walkthrough.
