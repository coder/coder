## AI Task Runner 🧠

Run AI-powered tasks directly in your workspaces. Coder Tasks let you describe what you want built in natural language — Coder spins up an isolated workspace, runs an AI coding agent, and delivers a pull request.

## Enhanced Workspace Search 🔍

The workspace list now supports rich filtering by template, status, owner, and last-used date. Pin your favorite workspaces and sort by any column.

## Devcontainer Support 📦

Templates can now reference devcontainer configurations. When a workspace starts, Coder automatically builds and runs the devcontainer defined in your repository — bringing full `devcontainer.json` compatibility to remote workspaces.

## Connection Diagnostics 🩺

A new `coder ping` command and dashboard health panel help you troubleshoot workspace connectivity issues. See latency, DERP relay paths, and direct connection status at a glance.
