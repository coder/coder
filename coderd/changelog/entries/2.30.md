## Dynamic Parameters 🎨

Template parameters now support dynamic options, validation, and conditional display logic — all powered by Terraform. Admins can create richer, more adaptive template inputs without any frontend changes.

## Prebuilt Workspaces ⚡

Reduce workspace startup times by keeping a pool of pre-provisioned workspaces warm and ready. When a user creates a workspace, they get a prebuilt one instantly.

## MCP Integration 🤖

The Coder CLI now includes an MCP server that AI agents can use to interact with workspaces. Run `coder mcp server` to start the server and connect it to your AI tools.

## Inbox Notifications 📬

A new in-app notification inbox lets users see workspace events, account changes, and template updates without leaving the dashboard.
