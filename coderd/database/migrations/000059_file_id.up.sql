-- This migration updates the files table to move the unique
-- constraint to be hash + created_by. This is necessary to
-- allow regular users who have been granted admin to a specific
-- template to be able to push and read files used for template
-- versions they create.
-- Prior to this collisions on file.hash were not an issue
-- since users who could push files could also read all files.
--
-- This migration also adds a 'files.id' column as the primary
-- key. As a side effect the provisioner_jobs must now reference
-- the files.id column since the 'hash' column is now ambiguous.
