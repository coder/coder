-- Take the locks this migration needs before changing anything, retrying
-- short waits so that concurrent chatd traffic cannot deadlock with it. See
-- 000609_chat_automations.up.sql for the reasoning. When this runs in the
-- same transaction as 000609, the locks are already held.
--
-- chat_automations is locked in the same attempt because 000612 alters it
-- and may run in this transaction. Holding chats while 000612 waits for an
-- automation row lock would block the holder's next step: an automation
-- update reads chats through its target_chat_id foreign key.
