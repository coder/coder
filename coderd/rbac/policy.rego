#
# This policy is specifically constructed to compress to a set of queries if the
# object's 'owner' and 'org_owner' fields are unknown. There is no specific set
# of rules that will guarantee that this policy has this property. However, there
# are some tricks. A unit test will enforce this property, so any edits that pass
# the unit test will be ok.
#
# Tricks: (It's hard to really explain this, fiddling is required)
# 1. Do not use unknown fields in any comprehension or iteration.
# 2. Use the unknown fields as minimally as possible.
# 3. Avoid making code branches based on the value of the unknown field.
#    Unknown values are like a "set" of possible values.
#    (This is why rule 1 usually breaks things)
#    For example:
#    In the org section, we calculate the 'allow' number for all orgs, rather
#    than just the input.object.org_owner. This is because if the org_owner
#    changes, then we don't need to recompute any 'allow' sets. We already have
#    the 'allow' for the changed value. So the answer is in a lookup table.
#    The final statement 'num := allow[input.object.org_owner]' does not have
#    different code branches based on the org_owner. 'num's value does, but
#    that is the whole point of partial evaluation.

# bool_flip lets you assign a value to an inverted bool.
# You cannot do 'x := !false', but you can do 'x := bool_flip(false)'
bool_flip(b) = flipped {
    b
    flipped = false
}

bool_flip(b) = flipped {
    not b
    flipped = true
}

# number is a quick way to get a set of {true, false} and convert it to
#  -1: {false, true} or {false}
#   0: {}
#   1: {true}
