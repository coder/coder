We are thrilled to release Coder v2.0.0. You can safely upgrade from any previous
[coder/coder](https://github.com/coder/coder) release,
but we feel like we have outgrown development (v0.x) releases:

- 1600+ users develop on Coder every day
- A single 4-core Coder server can [happily support](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/admin/scale) 1000+ users and workspace connections
- We have a full suite of [paid features](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/enterprise) and enterprise customers deployed in production
- Users depend on our CLI to [automate Coder](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/admin/automation) in Ci/Cd pipelines and templates

Why not v1.0? At the time of writing, our legacy product is currently on v1.34. While Coder v1 is being sunset, we still wanted to avoid versioning conflicts.

What is not changing:

- Our feature roadmap: See what we have planned at https://coder.com/roadmap
- Your upgrade path: You can safely upgrade from previous coder/coder releases to v2.x releases!
- Our release cadence: We want features out as quickly as possible and feature flag any work that isn‚Äôt ready for production yet!

What is changing:

- Our deprecation policy: Major features will be deprecated for at least 1 minor release before being removed. Any breaking changes to the REST API and SDK are done via minor releases and will be called out in our changelog.
- Regular scale testing: Follow along on our [ Google Sheets or Grafana dashboard ]

## Changelog

### BREAKING CHANGES

- RBAC: The default [Member role](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/admin/users) can no longer see a list of all users in a Coder deployment. The Template Admin role and above can still use the `Users` page in dashboard and query users via the API (#8650) (@Emyrk)
- Kubernetes (Helm): The [default ServiceAccount](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/8d0e8f45e0fb3802d777a396b4c027ab9788e1b8/helm/values.yaml#L67-L82) for Coder can provision `Deployments` on the cluster. (#8704) (@ericpaulsen)
  - This can be disabled by a [Helm value](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/8d0e8f45e0fb3802d777a396b4c027ab9788e1b8/helm/values.yaml#L78)
  - Our [Kubernetes example template](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/examples/templates/kubernetes) uses a `kubernetes_deployment` instead of `kubernetes_pod` since it works best with [log streaming](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/platforms/kubernetes/deployment-logs) in Coder.

### Features

- Template insights: Admins can see daily active users, user latency, and popular IDEs (#8722) (@BrunoQuaresma)
  ![Template insights](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22407953/258239988-69641bd6-28da-4c60-9ae7-c0b1bba53859.png)
- [Kubernetes log streaming](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/platforms/kubernetes/deployment-logs): Stream Kubernetes event logs to the Coder agent logs to reveal Kuernetes-level issues such as ResourceQuota limitations, invalid images, etc.
  ![Kubernetes quota](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coder/coder/main/docs/platforms/kubernetes/coder-logstream-kube-logs-quota-exceeded.png)
- [OIDC Role Sync](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/admin/auth#group-sync-enterprise) (Enterprise): Sync roles from your OIDC provider to Coder roles (e.g. `Template Admin`) (#8595) (@Emyrk)
- Users can convert their accounts from username/password authentication to SSO by linking their account (#8742) (@Emyrk)

- CLI: Added `--var` shorthand for `--variable` in `coder templates <create/push>` CLI (#8710) (@ammario)
- Accounts are marked as dormant after 90 days of inactivity and do not consume a license seat. When the user logs in again, their account status is reinstated. (#8644) (@mtojek)

- [Open in Coder](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/templates/open-in-coder): Generate a link that automatically creates a workspace on behalf of the user, skipping the "Create Workspace" form (#8651) (@BrunoQuaresma)
