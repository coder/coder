## Changelog

### Important changes

- [Managed variables](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/templates/parameters#terraform-template-wide-variables) are enabled by default. The following block within templates is obsolete and can be removed from your templates:

  ```diff
  provider "coder" {
  -  feature_use_managed_variables = "true"
  }
  ```

  > The change does not affect your templates because this attribute was previously necessary to activate this additional feature.

- Our scale test CLI is [experimental](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/contributing/feature-stages#experimental-features) to allow for rapid iteration. You can still interact with it via `coder exp scaletest` (#8339)
