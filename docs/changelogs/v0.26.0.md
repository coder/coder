## Changelog

### Important changes

- [Managed variables](https://coder.com/docs/templates/parameters#terraform-template-wide-variables)
  are enabled by default. The following block within templates is obsolete and
  can be removed from your templates:

  ```diff
  provider "coder" {
  -  feature_use_managed_variables = "true"
  }
  ```

  > The change does not affect your templates because this attribute was
  > previously necessary to activate this additional feature.

- Our scale test CLI is
  [experimental](https://coder.com/docs/about/feature-stages.md#early-access-features)
  to allow for rapid iteration. You can still interact with it via
  `coder exp scaletest` (#8339)
