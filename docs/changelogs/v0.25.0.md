> v0.26.0 which includes a fix

### Features

- The `coder stat` fetches workspace utilization metrics, even from within a
  container. Our example templates have been updated to use this to show CPU,
  memory, disk via
  [agent metadata](https://coder.com/docs/templates/agent-metadata)
  (#8005)
- Helm: `coder.command` can specify a different command for the Coder pod
  (#8116)
- Enterprise deployments can create templates without 'everyone' group access
  (#7982)
  ![Disable "everyone"](https://github.com/coder/coder/assets/22407953/1c31cb9b-be5c-4bef-abee-324856734215)
- Add login type 'none' to prevent password login. This can come in handy for
  machine accounts for CI/CD pipelines or other automation (#8009)
- Healthcheck endpoint has a database section: `/api/v2/debug/health`
- Force DERP connections in CLI with `--disable-direct` flag (#8131)
- Disable all direct connections for a Coder deployment with
  [--block-direct-connections](https://coder.com/docs/cli/server#--block-direct-connections)
  (#7936)
- Search for workspaces based on last activity (#2658)
