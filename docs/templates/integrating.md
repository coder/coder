# Integrating Coder

You can add Coder to your existing development environments:

* [Open in Coder](./open-in-coder.md): Provide a link that starts a new workspace from your git repo or internal wiki.
* [Docker in workspaces](./docker-in-workspaces.md): Run Docker in your container-based Code workspaces.
* [Devcontainers](./devcontainers.md): Run a devcontainer as a Coder workspace.
