# Icons

---

Coder uses icons in several places, including ones that can be configured
throughout the app, or specified in your Terraform. They're specified by a URL,
which can be to an image hosted on a CDN of your own, or one of the icons that
come included with your Coder deployment.

## Included icons

Coder includes icons for popular cloud providers and programming languages. You
can see all of the icons (or suggest new ones) in our repository on
[GitHub](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/site/static/icon).

You can also view the entire list, with search, by navigating to /icons on your
Coder deployment. E.g. [https://coder.example.com/icons](#). This can be
particularly useful in airgapped deployments.
