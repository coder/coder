# Agent Metadata

With Agent Metadata, template admin can expose key operational metrics from
their workspaces to their users. It is a sibling of [Resource Metadata](./resource-metadata.md).

See the [Terraform reference](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/coder/coder/latest/docs/resources/agent#metadata).
