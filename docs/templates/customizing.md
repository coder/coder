# Customizing templates

You can give developers more information and control over their workspaces:

* [Agent metadata](./agent-metadata.md): Show metrics about the running workspace.
* [Resource metadata](./resource-metadata.md): Show information about a workspace's resources.
* [Parameters](./parameters.md): Let the user customize their workspace.
