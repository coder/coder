Coding agents are rapidly emerging to help developers tackle repetitive tasks,
explore codebases, and generate solutions with increasing effectiveness.

You can run these agents in Coder workspaces to leverage the power of cloud resources
and deep integration with your existing development workflows.

## Why Run AI Coding Agents in Coder?

Coder provides unique advantages for running AI coding agents:

- **Consistent environments**: Agents work in the same standardized environments as your developers.
- **Resource optimization**: Leverage powerful cloud resources without taxing local machines.
- **Security and isolation**: Keep sensitive code, API keys, and secrets in controlled environments.
- **Seamless collaboration**: Multiple developers can observe and interact with agent activity.
- **Deep integration**: Status reporting and task management directly in the Coder UI.
- **Scalability**: Run multiple agents across multiple projects simultaneously.
- **Persistent sessions**: Agents can continue working even when developers disconnect.

## Types of Coding Agents

AI coding agents generally fall into two categories, both fully supported in Coder:

### Headless Agents

Headless agents can run without an IDE open, making them ideal for:

- **Background automation**: Execute repetitive tasks without supervision.
- **Resource-efficient development**: Work on projects without keeping an IDE running.
- **CI/CD integration**: Generate code, tests, or documentation as part of automated workflows.
- **Multi-project management**: Monitor and contribute to multiple repositories simultaneously.

Additionally, with Coder, headless agents benefit from:

- Status reporting directly to the Coder dashboard.
- Workspace lifecycle management (auto-stop).
- Resource monitoring and limits to prevent runaway processes.
- API-driven management for enterprise automation.

[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) is our recommended
coding agent due to its strong performance on complex programming tasks.

> [!INFO]
> Any agent can run in a Coder workspace via our [MCP integration](./headless.md),
> even if we don't have a specific module for it yet.

### In-IDE agents

In-IDE agents run within development environments like VS Code, Cursor, or Windsurf.

These are ideal for exploring new codebases, complex problem solving, pair programming,
or rubber-ducking.

## Agent status reports in the Coder dashboard

Claude Code and Goose can report their status directly to the Coder dashboard:

- Task progress appears in the workspace overview.
- Completion status is visible without opening the terminal.
- Error states are highlighted.
