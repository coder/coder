## Prerequisites

- A Coder deployment with v2.21 or later
- A [template configured for AI agents](./create-template.md)
- VS Code, Windsurf, or Cursor IDE with the
  [Coder Extension](https://github.com/coder/vscode-coder/releases) v1.6.0+ or
  the [experimental AI VSIX](https://github.com/coder/vscode-coder/releases/)

## Overview

Once you have an agent running and reporting activity to Coder, you can view the
status and switch between workspaces from the IDE. This can be very helpful for
reviewing code, working along with the agent, and more.
