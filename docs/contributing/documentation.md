# Documentation

This style guide is primarily for use with authoring documentation.

## General guidelines

- Use sentence case, even in titles (do not punctuate the title, though)
- Use the second person
- Use the active voice
- Use plural nouns and pronouns (_they_, _their_, or _them_), especially when
  the specific number is uncertain (i.e., "Set up your environments" even though
  you don't know if the user will have one or many environments)
- When writing documentation titles, use the noun form, not the gerund form (e.g., "Environment
  Management" instead of "Managing Environments")
- Context matters when you decide whether to capitalize something or not. For
  example, ["A Job creates one or more
  Pods..."](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/) is
  correct when writing about Kubernetes. However, in other contexts, neither
  _job_ nor _pods_ would be capitalized. Please follow the conventions set forth
  by the relevant companies and open source communities.

## How to format text

Below summarizes the text-formatting conventions you should follow.

### Bold

Use **bold** formatting when referring to UI elements.

### Italics

Use _italics_ for:

- Parameter names
- Mathematical and version variables

### Code font

Use _code font_ for:

- User text input
- Command-line utility names
- DNS record types
- Environment variable names (e.g., `PATH`)
- Filenames, filename extensions, and paths
- Folders and directories
- HTTP verbs, status codes, and content-type values
- Placeholder variables

Use _code blocks_ for code samples and other blocks of code. Be sure to indicate
the language your using to apply the proper syntax highlighting.

```text
This is a codeblock.
```

For code that you want users to enter via a command-line interface, use
`console`, not `bash`.

### Punctuation

Do not use the ampersand (&) as a shorthand for _and_ unless you're referring to a
UI element or the name of something that uses _&_.

You can use the symbol `~` in place of the word _approximately_.

### UI elements

When referring to UI elements, including the names for buttons, menus, dialogs,
and anything that has a name visible to the user, use bold font.

**Example:** On the **Environment Overview** page, click **Configure SSH**.

Don't use code font for UI elements unless it is rendered based on previously entered
text. For example, if you tell the user to provide the environment name as
`myEnvironment`, then use both bold and cold font when referring to the name.

**Example**: Click **`myEnvironment`**.

When writing out instructions that involve UI elements, both of the following options are acceptable:

- Go to **Manage** > **Users**.
- In the **Manage** menu, click **Users**.

## Product-specific references

Below summarizes the guidelines regarding how Coder terms should be used.

### Capitalized terms

The only Coder-specific terms that should be capitalized are the names of
products (e.g., Coder).

The exception is **code-server**, which is always lowercase. If it appears at the
beginning of the sentence, rewrite the sentence to avoid this usage.

### Uncapitalized terms

In general, we do not capitalize the names of features (unless the situation calls for it,
such as the word appearing at the beginning of a sentence):

- account dormancy
- audit logs
- autostart
- command-line interface
- dev URLs
- environment
- image
- metrics
- organizations
- progressive web app
- registries
- single sign-on
- telemetry
- workspace
- workspace providers
- workspaces as code

We also do not capitalize the names of user roles:

- auditor
- member
- site admin
- site manager

## Standardized spellings

- WiFi
