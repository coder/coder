# Backend

This guide is designed to support both Coder engineers and community contributors in understanding our backend systems and getting started with development.

Coder’s backend powers the core infrastructure behind workspace provisioning, access control, and the overall developer experience. As the backbone of our platform, it plays a critical role in enabling reliable and scalable remote development environments.

The purpose of this guide is to help you:

* Understand how the various backend components fit together.
* Navigate the codebase with confidence and adhere to established best practices.
* Contribute meaningful changes - whether you're fixing bugs, implementing features, or reviewing code.

## Platform Architecture

To understand how the backend fits into the broader system, we recommend reviewing the following resources:

* [General Concepts](../admin/infrastructure/validated-architectures/index.md#general-concepts): Essential concepts and language used to describe how Coder is structured and operated.

* [Architecture](../admin/infrastructure/architecture.md): A high-level overview of the infrastructure layout, key services, and how components interact.

These sections provide the necessary context for navigating and contributing to the backend effectively.

## Tech Stack

Coder's backend is built using a collection of robust, modern Go libraries and internal packages. Familiarity with these technologies will help you navigate the codebase and contribute effectively.

## Testing

The Coder backend includes a rich suite of unit and end-to-end tests. A variety of helper utilities are used throughout the codebase to make testing easier, more consistent, and closer to real behavior.

### [clitest](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/cli/clitest)

* Spawns an in-memory `serpent.Command` instance for unit testing
* Configures an authorized `codersdk` client
* Once a `serpent.Invocation` is created, tests can execute commands as if invoked by a real user

### [ptytest](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/pty/ptytest)

* `ptytest` attaches to a `serpent.Invocation` and simulates TTY input/output
* `pty` provides matchers and "write" operations for interacting with pseudo-terminals

## Recipes

### Adding database migrations and fixtures

#### Database migrations

Database migrations are managed with
[`migrate`](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate).

To add new migrations, use the following command:

```shell
./coderd/database/migrations/create_migration.sh my name
/home/coder/src/coder/coderd/database/migrations/000070_my_name.up.sql
/home/coder/src/coder/coderd/database/migrations/000070_my_name.down.sql
```

Then write queries into the generated `.up.sql` and `.down.sql` files and commit
them into the repository. The down script should make a best-effort to retain as
much data as possible.

Run `make gen` to generate models.

#### Database fixtures (for testing migrations)

There are two types of fixtures that are used to test that migrations don't
break existing Coder deployments:

* Partial fixtures
  [`migrations/testdata/fixtures`](../../coderd/database/migrations/testdata/fixtures)
* Full database dumps
  [`migrations/testdata/full_dumps`](../../coderd/database/migrations/testdata/full_dumps)

Both types behave like database migrations (they also
[`migrate`](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)). Their behavior mirrors
Coder migrations such that when migration number `000022` is applied, fixture
`000022` is applied afterwards.

Partial fixtures are used to conveniently add data to newly created tables so
that we can ensure that this data is migrated without issue.

Full database dumps are for testing the migration of fully-fledged Coder
deployments. These are usually done for a specific version of Coder and are
often fixed in time. A full database dump may be necessary when testing the
migration of multiple features or complex configurations.

To add a new partial fixture, run the following command:

```shell
./coderd/database/migrations/create_fixture.sh my fixture
/home/coder/src/coder/coderd/database/migrations/testdata/fixtures/000070_my_fixture.up.sql
```

Then add some queries to insert data and commit the file to the repo. See
[`000024_example.up.sql`](../../coderd/database/migrations/testdata/fixtures/000024_example.up.sql)
for an example.

To create a full dump, run a fully fledged Coder deployment and use it to
generate data in the database. Then shut down the deployment and take a snapshot
of the database.

```shell
mkdir -p coderd/database/migrations/testdata/full_dumps/v0.12.2 && cd $_
pg_dump "postgres://coder@localhost:..." -a --inserts >000069_dump_v0.12.2.up.sql
```

Make sure sensitive data in the dump is desensitized, for instance names,
emails, OAuth tokens and other secrets. Then commit the dump to the project.

To find out what the latest migration for a version of Coder is, use the
following command:

```shell
git ls-files v0.12.2 -- coderd/database/migrations/*.up.sql
```

This helps in naming the dump (e.g. `000069` above).
