# Feature stages

Some Coder features are released in feature stages before they are generally
available.

If you encounter an issue with any Coder feature, please submit a
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/coder/coder/issues) or join the
[Coder Discord](https://discord.gg/coder).

## Early access features

- **Stable**: No
- **Production-ready**: No
- **Support**: GitHub issues

Early access features are neither feature-complete nor stable. We do not
recommend using early access features in production deployments.

Coder releases early access features behind an “unsafe” experiment, where
they’re accessible but not easy to find.
They are disabled by default, and not recommended for use in
production as they may cause performance or stability issues. In most cases,
early access features are complete, but require further internal testing and
will stay in the early access stage for at least one month.

Coder may make significant changes or revert features to a feature flag at any time.

If you plan to activate an early access feature, we suggest that you use a
staging deployment.

```yaml
# Enable all early access  features
coder server --experiments=*

# Enable multiple early access features
coder server --experiments=feature1,feature2

# Alternatively, use the `CODER_EXPERIMENTS` environment variable.
```

You can opt-out of a feature after you've enabled it.
