## Requirements

<div class="tabs">

To get started with Coder, the easiest way to set up the required environment is to use the provided [Nix environment](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/nix).
Learn more [how Nix works](https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works).

### Nix

1. [Install Nix](https://nix.dev/install-nix#install-nix)

1. After you've installed Nix, instantiate the development with the `nix-shell`
   command:

   ```shell
   cd ~/code/coder

   # https://nix.dev/tutorials/declarative-and-reproducible-developer-environments
   nix-shell

   ...
   copying path '/nix/store/3ms6cs5210n8vfb5a7jkdvzrzdagqzbp-iana-etc-20210225' from 'https://   cache.nixos.org'...
   copying path '/nix/store/dxg5aijpyy36clz05wjsyk90gqcdzbam-iana-etc-20220520' from 'https://   cache.nixos.org'...
   copying path '/nix/store/v2gvj8whv241nj4lzha3flq8pnllcmvv-ignore-5.2.0.tgz' from 'https://cache.   nixos.org'...
   ...
   ```

1. Optional: If you have [direnv](https://direnv.net/) installed with
   [hooks configured](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html), you can add `use nix`
   to `.envrc` to automatically instantiate the development environment:

   ```shell
   cd ~/code/coder
   echo "use nix" >.envrc
   direnv allow
   ```

   Now, whenever you enter the project folder,
   [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) will prepare the environment
   for you:

   ```shell
   cd ~/code/coder

   direnv: loading ~/code/coder/.envrc
   direnv: using nix
   direnv: export +AR +AS +CC +CONFIG_SHELL +CXX +HOST_PATH +IN_NIX_SHELL +LD +NIX_BINTOOLS +NIX_BINTOOLS_WRAPPER_TARGET_HOST_x86_64_unknown_linux_gnu +NIX_BUILD_CORES +NIX_BUILD_TOP +NIX_CC +NIX_CC_WRAPPER_TARGET_HOST_x86_64_unknown_linux_gnu +NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE +NIX_ENFORCE_NO_NATIVE +NIX_HARDENING_ENABLE +NIX_INDENT_MAKE +NIX_LDFLAGS +NIX_STORE +NM +NODE_PATH +OBJCOPY +OBJDUMP +RANLIB +READELF +SIZE +SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH +STRINGS +STRIP +TEMP +TEMPDIR +TMP +TMPDIR +XDG_DATA_DIRS +buildInputs +buildPhase +builder +cmakeFlags +configureFlags +depsBuildBuild +depsBuildBuildPropagated +depsBuildTarget +depsBuildTargetPropagated +depsHostHost +depsHostHostPropagated +depsTargetTarget +depsTargetTargetPropagated +doCheck +doInstallCheck +mesonFlags +name +nativeBuildInputs +out +outputs +patches +phases +propagatedBuildInputs +propagatedNativeBuildInputs +shell +shellHook +stdenv +strictDeps +system ~PATH

   - If you encounter a `creating directory` error on macOS, check the
     [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

### Without Nix

If you're not using the Nix environment, you can launch a local [DevContainer](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/.devcontainer) to get a fully configured development environment.

DevContainers are supported in tools like **VS Code** and **GitHub Codespaces**, and come preloaded with all required dependencies: Docker, Go, Node.js with `pnpm`, and `make`.

</div>

## Development workflow

Use the following `make` commands and scripts in development:

- `./scripts/develop.sh` runs the frontend and backend development server
- `make build` compiles binaries and release packages
- `make install` installs binaries to `$GOPATH/bin`
- `make test`

### Running Coder on development mode

1. Run the development script to spin up the local environment:

   ```sh
   ./scripts/develop.sh
   ```

   This will start two processes:

   - http://localhost:3000 â€” the backend API server. Primarily used for backend development and also serves the *static* frontend build.
   - http://localhost:8080 â€” the Node.js frontend development server. Supports *hot reloading* and is useful if you're working on the frontend as well.

   Additionally, it starts a local PostgreSQL instance, creates both an admin and a member user account, and installs a default Docker-based template.

1. Verify Your Session

   Confirm that you're logged in by running:

   ```sh
   ./scripts/coder-dev.sh list
      ```

   This should return an empty list of workspaces. If you encounter an error, review the output from the [develop.sh](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/scripts/develop.sh) script for issues.

   > `coder-dev.sh` is a helper script that behaves like the regular coder CLI, but uses the binary built from your local source and shares the same configuration directory set up by `develop.sh`. This ensures your local changes are reflected when testing.
   >
   > The default user is `admin@coder.com` and the default password is `SomeSecurePassword!`

1. Create Your First Workspace

   A template named `docker` is created automatically. To spin up a workspace quickly, use:

   ```sh
   ./scripts/coder-dev.sh create my-workspace -t docker
   ```

### Deploying a PR

You need to be a member or collaborator of the [coder](https://github.com/coder) GitHub organization to be able to deploy a PR.

You can test your changes by creating a PR deployment. There are two ways to do
this:

- Run `./scripts/deploy-pr.sh`
- Manually trigger the
  [`pr-deploy.yaml`](https://github.com/coder/coder/actions/workflows/pr-deploy.yaml)
  GitHub Action workflow:

  <Image src="./images/deploy-pr-manually.png" alt="Deploy PR manually" height="348px" align="center" />

#### Available options

- `-d` or `--deploy`, force deploys the PR by deleting the existing deployment.
- `-b` or `--build`, force builds the Docker image. (generally not needed as we
  are intelligently checking if the image needs to be built)
- `-e EXPERIMENT1,EXPERIMENT2` or `--experiments EXPERIMENT1,EXPERIMENT2`, will
  enable the specified experiments. (defaults to `*`)
- `-n` or `--dry-run` will display the context without deployment. e.g., branch
  name and PR number, etc.
- `-y` or `--yes`, will skip the CLI confirmation prompt.

> [!NOTE]
> PR deployment will be re-deployed automatically when the PR is updated.
> It will use the last values automatically for redeployment.

Once the deployment is finished, a unique link and credentials will be posted in
the [#pr-deployments](https://codercom.slack.com/archives/C05DNE982E8) Slack
channel.

## Styling

Visit our [documentation style guide](./contributing/documentation.md).

Frontend styling guide can be found [here](./contributing/frontend.md#styling).

## Reviews

The following information has been borrowed from [Go's review philosophy](https://go.dev/doc/contribute#reviews).

Coder values thorough reviews. For each review comment that you receive, please
"close" it by implementing the suggestion or providing an explanation on why the
suggestion isn't the best option. Be sure to do this for each comment; you can
click **Done** to indicate that you've implemented the suggestion, or you can
add a comment explaining why you aren't implementing the suggestion (or what you
chose to implement instead).

It is perfectly normal for changes to go through several rounds of reviews, with
one or more reviewers making new comments every time, then waiting for an
updated change before reviewing again. All contributors, including those from
maintainers, are subject to the same review cycle; this process is not meant to
be applied selectively or to discourage anyone from contributing.

## Releases

Coder releases are initiated via
[`./scripts/release.sh`](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/scripts/release.sh)
and automated via GitHub Actions. Specifically, the
[`release.yaml`](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml)
workflow. They are created based on the current
[`main`](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main) branch.

The release notes for a release are automatically generated from commit titles
and metadata from PRs that are merged into `main`.

### Creating a release

The creation of a release is initiated via
[`./scripts/release.sh`](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/scripts/release.sh).
This script will show a preview of the release that will be created, and if you
choose to continue, create and push the tag which will trigger the creation of
the release via GitHub Actions.

See `./scripts/release.sh --help` for more information.

### Creating a release (via workflow dispatch)

Typically the workflow dispatch is only used to test (dry-run) a release,
meaning no actual release will take place. The workflow can be dispatched
manually from
[Actions: Release](https://github.com/coder/coder/actions/workflows/release.yaml).
Simply press "Run workflow" and choose dry-run.

If a release has failed after the tag has been created and pushed, it can be
retried by again, pressing "Run workflow", changing "Use workflow from" from
"Branch: main" to "Tag: vX.X.X" and not selecting dry-run.

### Commit messages

Commit messages should follow the
[Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
specification.

Allowed commit types (`feat`, `fix`, etc.) are listed in
[conventional-commit-types](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/c3a9be4c73e47f2e8197de775f41d981701407fb/index.json).
Note that these types are also used to automatically sort and organize the
release notes.

A good commit message title uses the imperative, present tense and is ~50
characters long (no more than 72).

Examples:

- Good: `feat(api): add feature X`
- Bad: `feat(api): added feature X` (past tense)

A good rule of thumb for writing good commit messages is to recite:
[If applied, this commit will ...](https://reflectoring.io/meaningful-commit-messages/).

**Note:** We lint PR titles to ensure they follow the Conventional Commits
specification, however, it's still possible to merge PRs on GitHub with a badly
formatted title. Take care when merging single-commit PRs as GitHub may prefer
to use the original commit title instead of the PR title.

### Breaking changes

Breaking changes can be triggered in two ways:

- Add `!` to the commit message title, e.g.
  `feat(api)!: remove deprecated endpoint /test`
- Add the
  [`release/breaking`](https://github.com/coder/coder/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Arelease%2Fbreaking)
  label to a PR that has, or will be, merged into `main`.

### Security

> [!CAUTION]
> If you find a vulnerability, **DO NOT FILE AN ISSUE**. Instead, send an email
> to <security@coder.com>.

The
[`security`](https://github.com/coder/coder/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Asecurity)
label can be added to PRs that have, or will be, merged into `main`. Doing so
will make sure the change stands out in the release notes.

### Experimental

The
[`release/experimental`](https://github.com/coder/coder/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Arelease%2Fexperimental)
label can be used to move the note to the bottom of the release notes under a
separate title.

## Troubleshooting

### Nix on macOS: `error: creating directory`

On macOS, a [direnv bug](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/issues/1345) can cause
`nix-shell` to fail to build or run `coder`. If you encounter
`error: creating directory` when you attempt to run, build, or test, add a
`mkdir` line to your `.envrc`:

```shell
use nix
mkdir -p "$TMPDIR"
```
