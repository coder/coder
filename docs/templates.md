# Templates

Templates are written in [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and describe the
infrastructure for workspaces (e.g., docker_container, aws_instance,
kubernetes_pod).

In most cases, a small group of users (team leads or Coder administrators) [have
permissions](./admin/users.md#roles) to create and manage templates. Then, other
users provision their [workspaces](./workspaces.md) from templates using the UI
or CLI.

## Get the CLI

The CLI and the server are the same binary. We did this to encourage virality so
individuals can start their own Coder deployments.

From your local machine, download the CLI for your operating system from the
[releases](https://github.com/coder/coder/releases/latest) or run:

```console
curl -fsSL https://coder.com/install.sh | sh
```

To see the sub-commands for managing templates, run:

```console
coder templates --help
```

## Login to your Coder Deployment

Before you can create templates, you must first login to your Coder deployment
with the CLI.

```console
coder login https://coder.example.com # aka the URL to your coder instance
```

This will open a browser and ask you to authenticate to your Coder deployment,
returning an API Key.

> Make a note of the API Key. You can re-use the API Key in future CLI logins or
> sessions.

```console
coder --token <your-api-key> login https://coder.example.com/ # aka the URL to your coder instance
```

## Add a template

Before users can create workspaces, you'll need at least one template in Coder.

```sh
# create a local directory to store templates
mkdir -p $HOME/coder/templates
cd $HOME/coder/templates

# start from an example
coder templates init

# optional: modify the template
vim <template-name>/main.tf

# add the template to Coder deployment
coder templates create <template-name>
```

> See the documentation and source code for each example as well as community
> templates in the
> [examples/](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/examples/templates)
> directory in the repo.

## Configure Max Workspace Autostop

To control cost, specify a maximum time to live flag for a template in hours or
minutes.

```sh
coder templates create my-template --ttl 4h
```

## Customize templates

Example templates are not designed to support every use (e.g
[examples/aws-linux](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/examples/templates/aws-linux)
does not support custom VPCs). You can add these features by editing the
Terraform code once you run `coder templates init` (new) or `coder templates pull` (existing).

Refer to the following resources to build your own templates:

- Terraform: [Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs) and
  [Registry](https://registry.terraform.io)
- Common [concepts in templates](#concepts-in-templates) and [Coder Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/coder/coder/latest/docs)
- [Coder example templates](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/examples/templates) code

## Concepts in templates

While templates are written with standard Terraform, the [Coder Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/coder/coder/latest/docs) is used to define the workspace lifecycle and establish a connection from resources
to Coder.

Below is an overview of some key concepts in templates (and workspaces). For all
template options, reference [Coder Terraform provider docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/coder/coder/latest/docs).

### Resource

Resources in Coder are simply [Terraform resources](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources).
If a Coder agent is attached to a resource, users can connect directly to the
resource over SSH or web apps.

### Coder agent

Once a Coder workspace is created, the Coder agent establishes a connection
between a resource (docker_container) and Coder, so that a user can connect to
their workspace from the web UI or CLI. A template can have multiple agents to
allow users to connect to multiple resources in their workspace.

> Resources must download and start the Coder agent binary to connect to Coder.
> This means the resource must be able to reach your Coder URL.

```hcl
data "coder_workspace" "me" {
}

resource "coder_agent" "pod1" {
  os   = "linux"
  arch = "amd64"
}

resource "kubernetes_pod" "pod1" {
  spec {
    ...
    container {
      command = ["sh", "-c", coder_agent.pod1.init_script]
      env {
        name  = "CODER_AGENT_TOKEN"
        value = coder_agent.dev.token
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `coder_agent` resource can be configured with additional arguments. For example,
you can use the `env` property to set environment variables that will be inherited
by all child processes of the agent, including SSH sessions. See the
[Coder Terraform Provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/coder/coder/latest/docs/resources/agent)
for the full list of supported arguments for the `coder_agent`.

#### startup_script

Use the Coder agent's `startup_script` to run additional commands like
installing IDEs, [cloning dotfiles](./dotfiles.md#templates), and cloning
project repos.

```hcl
resource "coder_agent" "coder" {
  os   = "linux"
  arch = "amd64"
  dir = "/home/coder"
  startup_script = <<EOT
#!/bin/bash

# Install code-server 4.8.3 under /tmp/code-server using the "standalone" installation
# that does not require root permissions. Note that /tmp may be mounted in tmpfs which
# can lead to increased RAM usage. To avoid this, you can pre-install code-server inside
# the Docker image or VM image.
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- --method=standalone --prefix=/tmp/code-server --version 4.8.3

# The & prevents the startup_script from blocking so the next commands can run.
# The stdout and stderr of code-server is redirected to /tmp/code-server.log.
/tmp/code-server/bin/code-server --auth none --port 13337 >/tmp/code-server.log 2>&1 &

# var.repo and var.dotfiles_uri is specified
# elsewhere in the Terraform code as input
# variables.

# clone repo
ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
git clone --progress git@github.com:${var.repo}

# use coder CLI to clone and install dotfiles
coder dotfiles -y ${var.dotfiles_uri}

  EOT
}
```

### Start/stop

[Learn about resource persistence in Coder](./templates/resource-persistence.md)

Coder workspaces can be started/stopped. This is often used to save on cloud
costs or enforce ephemeral workflows. When a workspace is started or stopped,
the Coder server runs an additional [terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands/apply),
informing the Coder provider that the workspace has a new transition state.

This template sample has one persistent resource (docker volume) and one
ephemeral resource (docker image).

```hcl
data "coder_workspace" "me" {
}

resource "docker_volume" "home_volume" {
  # persistent resource (remains a workspace is stopped)
  count = 1
  name  = "coder-${data.coder_workspace.me.id}-home"
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = all
  }
}

resource "docker_container" "workspace" {
  # ephemeral resource (deleted when workspace is stopped, created when started)
  count = data.coder_workspace.me.start_count # 0 (stopped), 1 (started)
  volumes {
    container_path = "/home/coder/"
    volume_name    = docker_volume.home_volume.name
    read_only      = false
  }
  # ... other config
}
```

#### Using updated images when rebuilding a workspace

To ensure that Coder uses an updated image when rebuilding a workspace, we
suggest that admins update the tag in the template (e.g., `my-image:v0.4.2` ->
`my-image:v0.4.3`) or digest (`my-image@sha256:[digest]` ->
`my-image@sha256:[new_digest]`).

Alternatively, if you're willing to wait for longer start times from Coder, you
can set the `imagePullPolicy` to `Always` in your Terraform template; when set,
Coder will check `image:tag` on every build and update if necessary:

```tf
resource "kubernetes_pod" "podName" {
    spec {
        container {
            image_pull_policy = "Always"
        }
    }
}
```

### Edit templates

You can edit a template using the coder CLI. Only [template admins and
owners](./admin/users.md) can edit a template.

Using the CLI, login to Coder and run the following command to edit a single
template:

```console
coder templates edit <template-name> --description "This is my template"
```

Review editable template properties by running `coder templates edit -h`.

Alternatively, you can pull down the template as a tape archive (`.tar`) to your
current directory:

```console
coder templates pull <template-name> file.tar
```

Then, extract it by running:

```sh
tar -xf file.tar
```

Make the changes to your template then run this command from the root of the
template folder:

```console
coder templates push <template-name>
```

Your updated template will now be available. Outdated workspaces will have a
prompt in the dashboard to update.

### Delete templates

You can delete a template using both the coder CLI and UI. Only [template admins
and owners](./admin/users.md) can delete a template, and the template must not
have any running workspaces associated to it.

Using the CLI, login to Coder and run the following command to delete a
template:

```console
coder templates delete <template-name>
```

In the UI, navigate to the template you want to delete, and select the dropdown
in the right-hand corner of the page to delete the template.

![delete-template](./images/delete-template.png)

#### Delete workspaces

When a workspace is deleted, the Coder server essentially runs a [terraform
destroy](https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands/destroy) to remove all resources
associated with the workspace.

> Terraform's
> [prevent-destroy](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy)
> and
> [ignore-changes](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#ignore_changes)
> meta-arguments can be used to prevent accidental data loss.

### Coder apps

By default, all templates allow developers to connect over SSH and a web
terminal. See [Configuring Web IDEs](./ides/web-ides.md) to learn how to give
users access to additional web applications.

### Data source

When a workspace is being started or stopped, the `coder_workspace` data source
provides some useful parameters. See the [Coder Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/coder/coder/latest/docs/data-sources/workspace) for more information.

For example, the [Docker quick-start template](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/examples/templates/docker)
sets a few environment variables based on the username and email address of the
workspace's owner, so that you can make Git commits immediately without any
manual configuration:

```tf
resource "coder_agent" "main" {
  # ...
  env = {
    GIT_AUTHOR_NAME = "${data.coder_workspace.me.owner}"
    GIT_COMMITTER_NAME = "${data.coder_workspace.me.owner}"
    GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL = "${data.coder_workspace.me.owner_email}"
    GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL = "${data.coder_workspace.me.owner_email}"
  }
}
```

You can add these environment variable definitions to your own templates, or
customize them however you like.

## Troubleshooting templates

Occasionally, you may run into scenarios where a workspace is created, but the
agent is either not connected or the [startup script](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/coder/coder/latest/docs/resources/agent#startup_script)
has failed or timed out.

### Agent connection issues

If the agent is not connected, it means the agent or [init script](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/provisionersdk/scripts)
has failed on the resource.

```console
$ coder ssh myworkspace
⢄⡱ Waiting for connection from [agent]...
```

While troubleshooting steps vary by resource, here are some general best
practices:

- Ensure the resource has `curl` installed (alternatively, `wget` or `busybox`)
- Ensure the resource can `curl` your Coder [access
  URL](./admin/configure.md#access-url)
- Manually connect to the resource and check the agent logs (e.g., `kubectl exec`, `docker exec` or AWS console)
  - The Coder agent logs are typically stored in `/tmp/coder-agent.log`
  - The Coder agent startup script logs are typically stored in `/tmp/coder-startup-script.log`
  - The Coder agent shutdown script logs are typically stored in `/tmp/coder-shutdown-script.log`
- This can also happen if the websockets are not being forwarded correctly when running Coder behind a reverse proxy. [Read our reverse-proxy docs](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/admin/configure#tls--reverse-proxy)

### Agent does not become ready

If the agent does not become ready, it means the [startup script](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/coder/coder/latest/docs/resources/agent#startup_script) is still running or has exited with a non-zero status. This also means the [login before ready](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/coder/coder/latest/docs/resources/agent#login_before_ready) option hasn't been set to true.

```console
$ coder ssh myworkspace
⢄⡱ Waiting for [agent] to become ready...
```

To troubleshoot readiness issues, check the agent logs as suggested above. You can connect to the workspace using `coder ssh` with the `--no-wait` flag. Please note that while this makes login possible, the workspace may be in an incomplete state.

```console
$ coder ssh myworkspace --no-wait

 > The workspace is taking longer than expected to get
   ready, the agent startup script is still executing.
   See troubleshooting instructions at: [...]

user@myworkspace $
```

If the startup script is expected to take a long time, you can try raising the timeout defined in the template:

```tf
resource "coder_agent" "main" {
  # ...
  login_before_ready = false
  startup_script_timeout  = 1800 # 30 minutes in seconds.
}
```

## Template permissions (enterprise)

Template permissions can be used to give users and groups access to specific
templates. [Learn more about RBAC](./admin/rbac.md).
