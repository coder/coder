# Integrations

Coder is highly extensible and is not limited to the platforms outlined in these
docs. The control plane can be provisioned on any VM or container compute, and
workspaces can include any Terraform resource. See our
[architecture diagram](../infrastructure/architecture.md) for more details.

You can host your deployment on almost any infrastructure. To learn how, read our [installation guides](../../install/README.md).

The following resources may help as you're deploying Coder.

- [Deploy workpsaces on multiple Kubernetes Clusters](./multiple-kube-clusters.md)
- [Get workspace build logs from Kubernetes](./kubernetes-logs.md)
- [Track deployment metrics with Prometheus](./prometheus.md)
- [Coder packages: one-click install on cloud providers](https://github.com/coder/packages)
- [Deploy Coder offline](../../install/offline.md)
- [Supported resources (Terraform registry)](https://registry.terraform.io)
- [Writing custom templates](../templates/README.md)
