# Application Logs

In Coderd, application logs refer to the records of events, messages, and activities generated by the application during its execution.
These logs provide valuable information about the application's behavior, performance, and any issues that may have occurred.

Application logs include entries that capture events on different levels of severity:

- Informational messages
- Warnings
- Errors
- Debugging information

By analyzing application logs, system administrators can gain insights into the application's behavior, identify and diagnose problems, track performance metrics, and make informed decisions to improve the application's stability and efficiency.

## Error logs

To ensure effective monitoring and timely response to critical events in the Coder application, it is recommended to configure log alerts
that specifically watch for the following log entries:

| Log Level | Module                       | Log message             | Potential issues                                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
