# Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC helps admins to control what their users and [groups](./groups.md) can access.

> **Note**:
> Right now, the only resource type where an admin can use RBAC is [Template](../templates.md) but we are planning to extend this capability to other resource types as well.

## Permissions

You can set the following permissions:

- **Admin**. Can edit and remove the resource including the permissions.
- **View**. Can only read and access the resource.

## Enabling this feature

This feature is auto enabled for all enterprise deployments. Admins may contact us to purchase a license [here](https://coder.com/contact?note=I%20want%20to%20upgrade%20my%20license).
