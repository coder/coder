# Reference Architecture: up to 2,000 users

In the 2,000 users architecture, there is a moderate increase in traffic,
suggesting a growing user base or expanding operations. This setup is
well-suited for mid-sized companies experiencing growth or for universities
seeking to accommodate their expanding user populations.

Users can be evenly distributed between 2 regions or be attached to different
clusters.

**Target load**: API: up to 300 RPS

**High Availability**: The mode is _disabled_, but administrators may consider
enabling it for deployment reliability.

## Hardware recommendations

### Coderd nodes

| Users       | Node capacity        | Replicas | GCP             | AWS         | Azure             |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------- | --------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Up to 2,000 | 4 vCPU, 16 GB memory | 2        | `n1-standard-4` | `t3.xlarge` | `Standard_D4s_v3` |

### Workspace nodes

| Users       | Node capacity        | Replicas | GCP              | AWS          | Azure             |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Up to 2,000 | 8 vCPU, 32 GB memory | 2        | `t2d-standard-8` | `t3.2xlarge` | `Standard_D8s_v3` |

TODO

Max pods per node 256

Developers for up to 2000+ users architecture are in 2 regions (a different
cluster) and are evenly split. In practice, this doesnâ€™t change much besides the
diagram and workspaces node pool autoscaling config as it still uses the central
provisioner. Recommend multiple provisioner groups for zero-trust and
multi-cloud use cases.

### Provisioner nodes

TODO

For example, to support 120 concurrent workspace builds:

- Create a cluster/nodepool with 4 nodes, 8-core each (AWS: `t3.2xlarge` GCP:
  `e2-highcpu-8`)
- Run coderd with 4 replicas, 30 provisioner daemons each.
  (`CODER_PROVISIONER_DAEMONS=30`)
- Ensure Coder's [PostgreSQL server](./configure.md#postgresql-database) can use
  up to 2 cores and 4 GB RAM
