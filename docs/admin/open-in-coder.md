# Open in Coder Button

Add a Markdown button to your project's `README.md` to get your developers up and running with Coder with a few clicks.

A basic example looks like this:

```markdown
[![Open in Coder](https://cdn.coder.com/embed-button.svg)](https://<deployment-url>/templates/<template-name>)
```

which renders like this:

![Open in Coder](https://cdn.coder.com/embed-button.svg)

You can customize this to take developers directly to your team's template. Read on to learn more.

### Customization

The underlying link for this button consists of the following pieces:
- <deployment-url>: where your Coder deployment lives i.e. https://dev.coder.com
- <template-name>: name of template i.e. coder

### template name

A template to redirect your developers to after they authenticate on your deployment.

Example: https://dev.coder.com/templates/coder
