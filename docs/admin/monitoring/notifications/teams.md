# Microsoft Teams Notifications

[Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams) is a widely
used collaboration platform, and with Coder's integration, you can enable
automated notifications directly within Teams using workflows and
[Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io/)

Administrators can configure Coder to send notifications via an incoming webhook
endpoint. These notifications appear as messages in Teams chats, either with the
Flow Bot or a specified user/service account.

## Requirements

Before setting up Microsoft Teams notifications, ensure that you have the
following:

- Administrator access to the Teams platform
- Coder platform with [notifications enabled](./index.md#enable-experiment)

## Build Teams Workflow

The process of setting up a Teams workflow consists of three key steps:

1.  Configure the Webhook Trigger.

    Begin by configuring the trigger: **"When a Teams webhook request is
    received"**.

    Ensure the trigger access level is set to **"Anyone"**.

2.  Setup the JSON Parsing Action.

    Next, add the **"Parse JSON"** action, linking the content to the **"Body"**
    of the received webhook request. Use the following schema to parse the
    notification payload:

    ```json
    {
    	"type": "object",
    	"properties": {
    		"_version": {
    			"type": "string"
    		},
    		"payload": {
    			"type": "object",
    			"properties": {
    				"_version": {
    					"type": "string"
    				},
    				"user_email": {
    					"type": "string"
    				},
    				"actions": {
    					"type": "array",
    					"items": {
    						"type": "object",
    						"properties": {
    							"label": {
    								"type": "string"
    							},
    							"url": {
    								"type": "string"
    							}
    						},
    						"required": ["label", "url"]
    					}
    				}
    			}
    		},
    		"title": {
    			"type": "string"
    		},
    		"body": {
    			"type": "string"
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

    This action parses the notification's title, body, and the recipient's email
    address.

3.  Configure the Adaptive Card Action.

    Finally, set up the **"Post Adaptive Card in a chat or channel"** action
    with the following recommended settings:

    **Post as**: Flow Bot

    **Post in**: Chat with Flow Bot

    **Recipient**: `user_email`

    Use the following _Adaptive Card_ template:

    ```json
    {
    	"$schema": "https://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    	"type": "AdaptiveCard",
    	"version": "1.0",
    	"body": [
    		{
    			"type": "Image",
    			"url": "https://coder.com/coder-logo-horizontal.png",
    			"height": "40px",
    			"altText": "Coder",
    			"horizontalAlignment": "center"
    		},
    		{
    			"type": "TextBlock",
    			"text": "**@{replace(body('Parse_JSON')?['title'], '"', '\"')}**"
    		},
    		{
    			"type": "TextBlock",
    			"text": "@{replace(body('Parse_JSON')?['body'], '"', '\"')}",
    			"wrap": true
    		},
    		{
    			"type": "ActionSet",
    			"actions": [@{replace(replace(join(body('Parse_JSON')?['payload']?['actions'], ','), '{', '{"type": "Action.OpenUrl",'), '"label"', '"title"')}]
    		}
    	]
    }
    ```

    _Notice_: The Coder `actions` format differs from the `ActionSet` schema, so
    its properties need to be modified: include `Action.OpenUrl` type, rename
    `label` to `title`. Unfortunately, there is no straightforward solution for
    `for-each` pattern.

    Feel free to customize the payload to modify the logo, notification title,
    or body content to suit your needs.

## Enable Webhook Integration

To enable webhook integration in Coder, ensure the "notifications"
[experiment is activated](./index.md#enable-experiment) (only required in
v2.15.X).

Then, define the POST webhook endpoint created by your Teams workflow:

```bash
export CODER_NOTIFICATIONS_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT=https://prod-16.eastus.logic.azure.com:443/workflows/f8fbe3e8211e4b638...`
```

Finally, go to the **Notification Settings** in Coder and switch the notifier to
**Webhook**.

## Limitations

1. **Public Webhook Trigger**: The Teams webhook trigger must be open to the
   public (**"Anyone"** can send the payload). It's recommended to keep the
   endpoint secret and apply additional authorization layers to protect against
   unauthorized access.

2. **Markdown Support in Adaptive Cards**: Note that Adaptive Cards support a
   [limited set of Markdown tags](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format?tabs=adaptive-md%2Cdesktop%2Cconnector-html).
