# Template

Templates are written in
[Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro) and define the
underlying infrastructure that all Coder workspaces run on.

## Learn the concepts

While templates are written in standard Terraform, it's important to learn the
Coder-specific concepts behind templates. The best way to learn the concepts is
by
[creating a basic template from scratch](../../tutorials/template-from-scratch.md).
If you are unfamiliar with Terraform, see
[Hashicorp's Tutorials](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials) for
common cloud providers.

## Starter templates

After learning the basics, use starter templates to import a template with
sensible defaults for popular platforms (e.g. AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, etc).
Docs:
[Create a template from a starter template](./creating-templates.md#from-a-starter-template).

## Extending templates

It's often necessary to extend the template to make it generally useful to end
users. Common modifications are:

- Your image(s) (e.g. a Docker image with languages and tools installed). Docs:
  [Image management](./managing-templates/image-management.md).
- Additional parameters (e.g. disk size, instance type, or region). Docs:
  [Template parameters](./extending-templates/parameters.md).
- Additional IDEs (e.g. JetBrains) or features (e.g. dotfiles, RDP). Docs:
  [Adding IDEs and features](./extending-templates/index.md).

Learn more about the various ways you can
[extend your templates](./extending-templates/index.md).

## Best Practices

We recommend starting with a universal template that can be used for basic
tasks. As your Coder deployment grows, you can create more templates to meet the
needs of different teams.

- [Image management](./managing-templates/image-management.md): Learn how to
  create and publish images for use within Coder workspaces & templates.
- [Dev Container support](./managing-templates/devcontainers.md): Enable dev
  containers to allow teams to bring their own tools into Coder workspaces.
- [Template hardening](./extending-templates/resource-persistence.md#-bulletproofing):
  Configure your template to prevent certain resources from being destroyed
  (e.g. user disks).
- [Manage templates with Ci/Cd pipelines](./managing-templates/change-management.md):
  Learn how to source control your templates and use GitOps to ensure template
  changes are reviewed and tested.
- [Permissions and Policies](./template-permissions.md): Control who may access
  and modify your template.
