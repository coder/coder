# Envbuilder

Envbuilder shifts environment definition from template administrators to
developers. Instead of baking tools into template images, developers define
their environments via `devcontainer.json` files in their repositories.

Envbuilder transforms the workspace image itself from a dev container
configuration, without requiring a Docker daemon.

For setup instructions, see
[Envbuilder documentation](../../integrations/devcontainers/envbuilder/index.md).

For an alternative that uses Docker inside workspaces, see
[Dev Containers Integration](../../integrations/devcontainers/integration.md).
