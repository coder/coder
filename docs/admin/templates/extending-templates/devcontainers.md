# Dev Containers

Dev containers extend your template with containerized development environments,
allowing developers to work in consistent, reproducible setups defined by
`devcontainer.json` files.

Coder's main Dev Containers Integration uses the standard `@devcontainers/cli` and
Docker to run containers inside workspaces.

For setup instructions, see
[Dev Containers Integration](../../integrations/devcontainers/integration.md).

For alternative approaches and comparisons between them, see the
[Dev Containers](../../integrations/devcontainers/index.md) page.
