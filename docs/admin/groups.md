# Groups

Groups can be used with [template RBAC](./rbac.md) to give groups of users
access to specific templates. They can be defined via the Coder web UI,
[synced from your identity provider](./auth.md) or
[managed via Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/coder/coderd/latest/docs/resources/template).
