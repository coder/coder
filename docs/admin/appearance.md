## OIDC Login Button Customization

[Use environment variables to customize](../auth#oidc-login-customization) the
text and icon on the OIDC button on the Sign In page.

## Support Links

Support links let admins adjust the user dropdown menu to include links
referring to internal company resources. The menu section replaces the original
menu positions: documentation, report a bug to GitHub, or join the Discord
server.

![support links](../images/admin/support-links.png)

Custom links can be set in the deployment configuration using the
`-c <yamlFile>` flag to `coder server`.

```yaml
supportLinks:
  - name: "On-call ðŸ”¥"
    target: "http://on-call.example.internal"
    icon: "bug"
  - name: "ðŸ˜‰ Getting started with Go!"
    target: "https://go.dev/"
  - name: "Community"
    target: "https://github.com/coder/coder"
    icon: "chat"
```

### Icons

The link icons are optional, and limited to: `bug`, `chat`, and `docs`.
