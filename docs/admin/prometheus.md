# Prometheus

Coder exposes many metrics which can be consumed by a Prometheus server, and give insight into the current state of a live Coder deployment.

If you don't have an Prometheus server installed, you can follow the Prometheus [Getting started](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/) guide.

## Enable Prometheus metrics

Coder server exports metrics via the HTTP endpoint, which can be enabled using either the environment variable `CODER_PROMETHEUS_ENABLE` or the flag `--prometheus-enable`.

The Prometheus endpoint address is `http://localhost:2112/` by default. You can use either the environment variable `CODER_PROMETHEUS_ADDRESS` or the flag ` --prometheus-address <network-interface>:<port>` to select a different listen address.

__Notice__: Prometheus endpoint is not supported by the official Coder Helm chart yet.

If `coder server --prometheus-enable` is started locally, you can preview the metrics endpoint in your browser or by using curl: <!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->http://localhost:2112/<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->.

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:2112/
# HELP coderd_api_active_users_duration_hour The number of users that have been active within the last hour.
# TYPE coderd_api_active_users_duration_hour gauge
coderd_api_active_users_duration_hour 0
...
```
