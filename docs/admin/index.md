# Administration

These guides contain information on managing the Coder control plane and
[authoring templates](./templates/index.md).

First time viewers looking to set up control plane access can start with the
[configuration guide](./setup/index.md). If you're a team lead looking to design
environments for your developers, check out our
[templates guides](./templates/index.md). If you are a developer using Coder, we
recommend the [user guides](../user-guides/index.md).

For automation and scripting workflows, see our [CLI](../reference/cli/index.md)
and [API](../reference/api/index.md) docs.

For any information not strictly contained in these sections, check out our
[Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) and [FAQs](../tutorials/faqs.md).
