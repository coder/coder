# Administration

These guides contain information on managing the Coder control plane and [authoring templates](./templates/README.md).

First time viewers looking to set up control plane access can start with the [configuration guide](./setup/README.md). If you're a team lead looking to design environments for your developers, check out our [templates guides](./templates/README.md). If you are a developer using Coder, we recommend the [user guides](../user-guides/README.md).

For automation and scripting workflows, see our [CLI](../reference/cli/README.md) and [API](../reference/api/README.md) docs.

For any information not strictly contained in these sections, check out our [Tutorials](../tutorials/README.md) and [FAQs](../tutorials/faqs.md).
