# Organizations - best practices

December 9, 2024

---

Coder [Organizations](../../admin/users/organizations.md) allow administrators
finer control over groups, templates, workspaces, and provisioners within their
Coder deployment.

Organizations allow multiple platform teams to offer templates and
infrastructure to their users instead of having them entirely managed in a
centralized fashion.

Each organization can have its own unique admin and users can belong to multiple
organizations, but every organization must have separate templates,
provisioners, groups, and workspaces.

On this best practice page, we cover some of the ways you can use Organizations
to make it easier to manage your groups smoothly.

## How Coder organizations work

Organizations are the hierarchical parent for templates, groups, and
provisioners. Every new organization must have separate templates, provisioners,
and groups.

![Organizations architecture](../../images/best-practice/organizations-architecture.png)

Users can belong to multiple organizations while templates and provisioners
cannot.

## When to use organizations

Organizations increase the maintenance overhead of a Coder deployment, so we
recommend that you only use them when necessary.

Use organizations when a separate group of users needs to manage their own
templates and underlying infrastructure. If a group of users already has a
separate, functional platform team willing to write templates or manage
clusters, organizations may be a good fit.

### Organization use case examples

Here are a few examples for a fictional organization called MegaCo. It is
deployed with Coder and has 1000 users in production. Today, MegaCo has a single
(default) organization and a central platform team but is evaluating whether to
use organizations for several use cases.

## How to migrate to organizations

Since templates and workspaces cannot be moved nor can they belong to multiple
organizations, we recommend that you deprecate your template
[through the API](../../reference/api/templates.md#update-template-metadata-by-id)
or [through the Coder CLI](../../reference/cli/templates_edit.md#--deprecated).
When a template is deprecated, the admin prevents new workspaces from being
created and developers are notified with a deprecation message which can link to
an external wiki page on migration instructions.

Users can use a file transfer tool such as
[rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) to migrate their files from one
workspace to another.

## Provisioner Isolation and Zero Trust

In the organizations model, provisioners run in a separate
cluster/infrastructure and have an isolated key to authenticate back with Coder.
The provisioners have access to separate cloud resources that the control plane
cannot access. Instead, the control plane sends simple "provisioner jobs" to the
provisioner and the provisioner is responsible for executing the Terraform.

There are planned improvements to the troubleshooting provisioners process.

- [coder/coder#15087](https://github.com/coder/coder/issues/15087)
- [coder/coder#15192](https://github.com/coder/coder/issues/15192)

## Identity Provider (SSO) Sync

While the Coder UI or API can be used to assign specific users to organizations,
this is discouraged. Instead, we recommend syncing the state from your identity
provider such as Okta. A single claim from the identity provider (like
`memberOf`) can be used to sync site-wide roles, organizations, groups, and
organization roles.

### Planned enhancements

Site-wide role sync is managed via server flags. We plan on changing this to
runtime configuration so Coder does not need a re-deploy:

- Issue [coder/internal#86](https://github.com/coder/internal/issues/86)

Make all sync configurable via the dashboard UI:

- [coder/coder#15290](https://github.com/coder/coder/issues/15290)

Regex filters and mapping can be configured to ensure the proper resources are
allocated in Coder. Learn more about [IDP sync](../../admin/users/idp-sync.md).

## Custom Roles

Custom roles are organization-scoped and can be used to limit access controls
within an organization. Custom roles can be applied to the default organization.

Some examples of custom roles that can be created:

### Provisioner Admin

- The user can deploy provisioners but not manage templates. This may be useful
  if automation is used to create and update templates in the organization.

### Template Editor

- Inverse of provisioner admin: User can manage templates but not deploy
  provisioners. This may be useful if the provisioner and template are deployed
  via automation and users are allowed to edit them.

### Template Pusher

- A system account that can push new templates from a git repo but cannot manage
  users or delete templates.

We’re interested in identifying new use cases for custom roles. Please
[create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/coder/internal/issues/new?title=request%28orgs%29%3A+request+title+here&labels=["customer-feedback"]&body=please+enter+your+request+here)
with your suggestion or request.

## Managing Organizations at Scale

Using ClickOps to onboard new organizations, set quotas, and SSO sync can be
cumbersome, especially if you want to "seed" organizations with provisioners and
starter templates.

Support for managing Organizations via the coderd Terrafom provider is planned
so that this can be done declaratively and bulk updates to things like templates
and quotas can be performed easily:
