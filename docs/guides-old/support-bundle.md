When you engage with Coder support to diagnose an issue with your deployment,
you may be asked to generate and upload a "Support Bundle" for offline analysis.
This document explains the contents of a support bundle and the steps to submit
a support bundle to Coder staff.

## What is a Support Bundle?

A support bundle is an archive containing a snapshot of information about your
Coder deployment.

It contains information about the workspace, the template it uses, running
agents in the workspace, and other detailed information useful for
troubleshooting.

It is primarily intended for troubleshooting connectivity issues to workspaces,
but can be useful for diagnosing other issues as well.

**While we attempt to redact sensitive information from support bundles, they
may contain information deemed sensitive by your organization and should be
treated as such.**

A brief overview of all files contained in the bundle is provided below:

> Note: detailed descriptions of all the information available in the bundle is
> out of scope, as support bundles are primarily intended for internal use.

## How do I generate a Support Bundle?

1. Ensure your deployment is up and running. Generating a support bundle
   requires the Coder deployment to be available.

2. Ensure you have the Coder CLI installed on a local machine. See
   [installation](../install/index.md) for steps on how to do this.

   > Note: It is recommended to generate a support bundle from a location
   > experiencing workspace connectivity issues.

3. Ensure you are [logged in](../cli/login.md#login) to your Coder deployment as
   a user with the Owner privilege.

4. Run `coder support bundle [owner/workspace]`, and respond `yes` to the
   prompt. The support bundle will be generated in the current directory with
   the filename `coder-support-$TIMESTAMP.zip`.

   > While support bundles can be generated without a running workspace, it is
   > recommended to specify one to maximize troubleshooting information.

5. (Recommended) Extract the support bundle and review its contents, redacting
   any information you deem necessary.

6. Coder staff will provide you a link where you can upload the bundle along
   with any other necessary supporting files.

   > Note: It is helpful to leave an informative message regarding the nature of
   > supporting files.

Coder support will then review the information you provided and respond to you
with next steps.
