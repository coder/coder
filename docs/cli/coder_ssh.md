## coder ssh

Start a shell into a workspace

```
coder ssh <workspace> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -A, --forward-agent                      Specifies whether to forward the SSH agent specified in $SSH_AUTH_SOCK.
                                           Consumes $CODER_SSH_FORWARD_AGENT
  -G, --forward-gpg                        Specifies whether to forward the GPG agent. Unsupported on Windows workspaces, but supports all clients. Requires gnupg (gpg, gpgconf) on both the client and workspace. The GPG agent must already be running locally and will not be started for you. If a GPG agent is already running in the workspace, it will be attempted to be killed.
                                           Consumes $CODER_SSH_FORWARD_GPG
  -h, --help                               help for ssh

      --no-wait                            Specifies whether to wait for a workspace to become ready before logging in (only applicable when the delay login until ready option is enabled). Note that the workspace agent may still be in the process of executing the startup script and the workspace may be in an incomplete state.
                                           Consumes $CODER_SSH_NO_WAIT
      --stdio                              Specifies whether to emit SSH output over stdin/stdout.
                                           Consumes $CODER_SSH_STDIO
      --workspace-poll-interval duration   Specifies how often to poll for workspace automated shutdown.
                                           Consumes $CODER_WORKSPACE_POLL_INTERVAL (default 1m0s)
