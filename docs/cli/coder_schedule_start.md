## coder schedule start

Edit workspace start schedule

### Synopsis

Schedules a workspace to regularly start at a specific time.
Schedule format: <start-time> [day-of-week] [location].

- Start-time (required) is accepted either in 12-hour (hh:mm{am|pm}) format, or 24-hour format hh:mm.
- Day-of-week (optional) allows specifying in the cron format, e.g. 1,3,5 or Mon-Fri.
  Aliases such as @daily are not supported.
  Default: \* (every day)
- Location (optional) must be a valid location in the IANA timezone database.
  If omitted, we will fall back to either the TZ environment variable or /etc/localtime.
  You can check your corresponding location by visiting https://ipinfo.io - it shows in the demo widget on the right.
