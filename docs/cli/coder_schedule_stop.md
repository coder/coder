# coder schedule stop

Schedules a workspace to stop after a given duration has elapsed.

- Workspace runtime is measured from the time that the workspace build completed.
- The minimum scheduled stop time is 1 minute.
- The workspace template may place restrictions on the maximum shutdown time.
- Changes to workspace schedules only take effect upon the next build of the workspace,
  and do not affect a running instance of a workspace.

When enabling scheduled stop, enter a duration in one of the following formats:

- 3h2m (3 hours and two minutes)
- 3h (3 hours)
- 2m (2 minutes)
- 2 (2 minutes)

## Usage

```console
coder schedule stop <workspace-name> { <duration> | manual } [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
  $ coder schedule stop my-workspace 2h30m
```
