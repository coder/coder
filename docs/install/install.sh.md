The easiest way to install Coder is to use our [install script](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/install.sh) for Linux and macOS.

To install, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://coder.com/install.sh | sh
```

You can preview what occurs during the install process:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://coder.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --dry-run
```

You can modify the installation process by including flags. Run the help command for reference:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://coder.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --help
```

After installing, use the instructions in your terminal to start the Coder server and create your first account.
