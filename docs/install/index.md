# Installing Coder

A single CLI (`coder`) is used for both the Coder server and the client.

We support two release channels: mainline and stable - read the
[Releases](./releases.md) page to learn more about which best suits your team.

There are several ways to install Coder. For production deployments with 50+
users, we recommend [installing on Kubernetes](./kubernetes.md). Otherwise, you
can install Coder on your local machine or on a VM:

## Linux/macOS

Our install script is the fastest way to install Coder on Linux/macOS:

```sh
curl -L https://coder.com/install.sh | sh
```

Refer to [GitHub releases](https://github.com/coder/coder/releases) for
alternate installation methods (e.g. standalone binaries, system packages).

## Windows

> **Important:** If you plan to use the built-in PostgreSQL database, you will
> need to ensure that the
> [Visual C++ Runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version)
> is installed.

Use [GitHub releases](https://github.com/coder/coder/releases) to download the
Windows installer (`.msi`) or standalone binary (`.exe`).

package manager to install Coder:

```powershell
