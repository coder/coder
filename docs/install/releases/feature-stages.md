# Feature stages

Some Coder features are released in feature stages before they are generally
available.

If you encounter an issue with any Coder feature, please submit a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/coder/coder/issues) or join the
[Coder Discord](https://discord.gg/coder).

## Feature stages

| Feature stage                          | Stable | Production-ready | Support                    | Description                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------|--------|------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Early Access](#early-access-features) | No     | No               | No support (GitHub issues) | For staging only. Not feature-complete or stable. Disabled by default.                                                |
| [Beta](#beta)                          | No     | Not fully        | Best effort (no SLA)       | Publicly available. Mostly stable with minor bugs. Suitable for staging; optional for production. Not covered by SLA. |
| [GA](#general-availability-ga)         | Yes    | Yes              | License-based              | Stable and tested. Fully documented. Support based on license.                                                        |

## Early access features

- **Stable**: No
- **Production-ready**: No
- **Support**: No support, no SLA. Bugs, feature requests, and feedback are
  escalated directly to the product team. You can submit feedback through
  [GitHub issues](https://github.com/coder/coder/issues).

Early access features are neither feature-complete nor stable.
**Do not use early access features in production deployments.**

Early access features are also referred to internally as MVP, Phase 1, or Alpha.
These features are rough around the edges, may be missing functionality, and
bugs are expected. Coder may make significant changes to or completely remove
early access features at any time.

### Early access feature requirements

- **Opt-in only**: Early access features are always disabled by default.
  Administrators must explicitly enable them, typically via a server flag such
  as `CODER_EXPERIMENTS`.
- **Experimental naming**: API routes and CLI commands for early access features
  use "experimental" naming conventions. These experimental routes are
  deprecated when the feature moves to Beta.
- **Staging only**: When testing out early access features, we strongly advise
  using a staging deployment.

<details><summary>To enable early access features:</summary>

Use the [Coder CLI](../../install/cli.md) `--experiments` flag to enable early
access features:

- Enable all early access features:

  ```shell
  coder server --experiments=*
  ```

- Enable multiple early access features:

  ```shell
  coder server --experiments=feature1,feature2
  ```

You can also use the `CODER_EXPERIMENTS`
[environment variable](../../admin/setup/index.md).

You can opt-out of a feature after you've enabled it.

<!-- BEGIN: available-experimental-features -->

Currently no experimental features are available in the latest mainline or
stable release.

<!-- END: available-experimental-features -->

## Beta

- **Stable**: No
- **Production-ready**: Not fully
- **Support**: Best effort support (no SLA). Approximately 60% of support
  tickets are escalated to the product team. You can also reach out via
  [Documentation](../../README.md), [Discord](https://discord.gg/coder), and
  [GitHub issues](https://github.com/coder/coder/issues).

Beta features are publicly available and tagged with a `Beta` label. They are
generally stable with a mostly complete feature set, though minor bugs may
exist.

### Beta feature characteristics

- **Opt-in**: Beta features are not enabled by default. Unlike Early Access
  features, Beta features can be naturally discovered via the product and
  documentation without requiring `CODER_EXPERIMENTS` flags. Administrators can
  enable them through standard configuration.
- **Generally Stable API, without Guarantees**: The goal for Beta is to achieve a generally stable feature set
  and API. Significant API changes are not expected between Beta and GA.
- **Feature complete**: Beta features generally contain the same features as GA.
  The focus between Beta and GA is on stability and bug fixes, not adding new
  functionality.
- **Production optional**: You can use Beta features in production, but should
  inform users that some rough edges may exist. We recommend testing in staging
  environments first.

Beta features will typically be ready for general availability within two to three
releases. We keep documentation about Beta features up-to-date with the latest
information, including planned features, limitations, and workarounds.

Beta features are not covered within service-level agreements (SLA). If you
encounter an issue, please contact your
[Coder account team](https://coder.com/contact), reach out on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/coder), or create a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/coder/coder/issues) if there isn't one
already.

Beta features are announced through the
[Coder Changelog](https://coder.com/changelog), and more information is
available in the documentation.

## General Availability (GA)

- **Stable**: Yes
- **Production-ready**: Yes
- **Support**: Yes, [based on license](https://coder.com/pricing).

All features that are not explicitly tagged as `Early access` or `Beta` are
considered generally available (GA). They have been tested and are stable.

### Transition from Beta to GA

The transition from Beta to GA focuses primarily on:

- **Stability**: Ensuring the feature works reliably across various conditions.
- **Scale**: Verifying performance under production workloads.
- **Compatibility**: Testing across a wider set of Coder versions and
  environments.

A feature should fit at least 80% of planned use cases before reaching GA.

### GA feature characteristics

- **Enabled by default**: Most GA features are enabled by default. However,
  features that require extra configuration (such as Prebuilds or external
  integrations) may remain opt-in by design, even in GA.
- **Full documentation**: GA features have complete documentation that outlines
  how to use or implement the feature, including configuration options,
  troubleshooting, and instructions for disabling features in air-gapped
  deployments where applicable.

If your Coder license includes an SLA, please consult it for an outline of
specific expectations.

For support, consult our knowledgeable and growing community on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/coder), or create a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/coder/coder/issues) if one doesn't exist
already. Customers with a valid Coder license can submit a support request or
contact your [account team](https://coder.com/contact).

We intend [Coder documentation](../../README.md) to be the
[single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth)
and all features should have complete documentation that outlines how to use or
implement a feature. If you discover an error or if you have a suggestion that
could improve the documentation, please
[submit a GitHub issue](https://github.com/coder/internal/issues/new?title=request%28docs%29%3A+request+title+here&labels=["customer-feedback","docs"]&body=please+enter+your+request+here).

Some GA features can be disabled for air-gapped deployments. Consult the
feature's documentation or submit a support ticket for assistance.
