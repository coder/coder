# Dotfiles

Coder offers the `coder dotfiles <repo>` command which simplifies workspace
personalization. Our behavior is consistent with Codespaces, so
[their documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account#dotfiles)
explains how it loads your repo.

You can read more on dotfiles best practices [here](https://dotfiles.github.io).

## Templates

Templates can prompt users for their dotfiles repo using the following pattern:

```hcl
variable "dotfiles_uri" {
  description = <<-EOF
  Dotfiles repo URI (optional)

  see https://dotfiles.github.io
  EOF
    # The codercom/enterprise-* images are only built for amd64
  default = ""
}

resource "coder_agent" "dev" {
  ...
  startup_script = var.dotfiles_uri != "" ? "/tmp/tmp.coder*/coder dotfiles -y ${var.dotfiles_uri}" : null
}
```

[Here's a complete example.](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/examples/templates/docker-with-dotfiles#how-it-works)

## Persistent Home

Sometimes you wants to support personalization without
requiring dotfiles.

In such cases:

- Mount a persistent volume to the `/home` directory
- Set the `startup_script` to call a `~/personalize` script that the user can edit

```hcl
resource "coder_agent" "dev" {
  ...
  startup_script = "/home/coder/personalize"
}
```

The user can even fill `personalize` with `coder dotfiles <repo>`, but those
looking for a simpler approach can inline commands like so:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update
# Install some of my favorite tools every time my workspace boots
sudo apt install -y neovim fish cargo
```
