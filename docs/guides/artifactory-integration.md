Use Coder and JFrog Artifactory together to secure your development environments
without disturbing your developers' existing workflows.

This guide will demonstrate how to use JFrog Artifactory as a package registry
within a workspace.

## Requirements

- A JFrog Artifactory instance
- 1:1 mapping of users in Coder to users in Artifactory by email address or
  username
- Repositories configured in Artifactory for each package manager you want to
  use

## Provisioner Authentication

The most straight-forward way to authenticate your template with Artifactory is
by using our official Coder [modules](https://registry.coder.com). We publish
two type of modules that automate the JFrog Artifactory and Coder integration.

1. JFrog-OAuth
2. JFrog-Token

### JFrog-OAuth

This module is usable by JFrog self-hosted (on-premises) Artifactory as it
requires configuring a custom integration. This integration benefits from
Coder's [external-auth](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/admin/external-auth)
feature and allows each user to authenticate with Artifactory using an OAuth
flow and issues user-scoped tokens to each user.

To set this up, follow these steps:

1. Modify your Helm chart `values.yaml` for JFrog Artifactory to add,

```yaml
artifactory:
  enabled: true
  frontend:
  extraEnvironmentVariables:
    - name: JF_FRONTEND_FEATURETOGGLER_ACCESSINTEGRATION
      value: "true"
  access:
  accessConfig:
    integrations-enabled: true
    integration-templates:
      - id: "1"
        name: "CODER"
        redirect-uri: "https://CODER_URL/external-auth/jfrog/callback"
        scope: "applied-permissions/user"
```

> Note Replace `CODER_URL` with your Coder deployment URL, e.g.,
> <coder.example.com>

2. Create a new Application Integration by going to
   <https://JFROG_URL/ui/admin/configuration/integrations/new> and select the
   Application Type as the integration you created in step 1.

3. Add a new
   [external authentication](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/admin/external-auth)
   to Coder by setting these env variables,

```env
# JFrog Artifactory External Auth
CODER_EXTERNAL_AUTH_1_ID="jfrog"
CODER_EXTERNAL_AUTH_1_TYPE="jfrog"
CODER_EXTERNAL_AUTH_1_CLIENT_ID="YYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
CODER_EXTERNAL_AUTH_1_CLIENT_SECRET="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
CODER_EXTERNAL_AUTH_1_DISPLAY_NAME="JFrog Artifactory"
CODER_EXTERNAL_AUTH_1_DISPLAY_ICON="/icon/jfrog.svg"
CODER_EXTERNAL_AUTH_1_AUTH_URL="https://JFROG_URL/ui/authorization"
CODER_EXTERNAL_AUTH_1_SCOPES="applied-permissions/user"
```

> Note Replace `JFROG_URL` with your JFrog Artifactory base URL, e.g.,
> <example.jfrog.io>

4. Create or edit a Coder template and use the
   [JFrog-OAuth](https://registry.coder.com/modules/jfrog-oauth) module to
   configure the integration.

```hcl
module "jfrog" {
  source = "registry.coder.com/modules/jfrog-oauth/coder"
  version = "1.0.0"
  agent_id = coder_agent.example.id
  jfrog_url = "https://jfrog.example.com"
  configure_code_server = true # this depends on the code-server
  username_field = "username" # If you are using GitHub to login to both Coder and Artifactory, use username_field = "username"
  package_managers = {
    "npm": "npm",
    "go": "go",
    "pypi": "pypi"
  }
}
```

### JFrog-Token

This module makes use of the
[Artifactory terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/jfrog/artifactory/latest/docs)
and an admin-scoped token to create user-scoped tokens for each user by matching
their Coder email or username with Artifactory. This can be used for both SaaS
and self-hosted(on-premises) Artifactory instances.

To set this up, follow these steps:

1. Get a JFrog access token from your Artifactory instance. The token must be an
   [admin token](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/jfrog/artifactory/latest/docs#access-token)
   with scope `applied-permissions/admin`.
2. Create or edit a Coder template and use the
   [JFrog-Token](https://registry.coder.com/modules/jfrog-token) module to
   configure the integration and pass the admin token. It is recommended to
   store the token in a sensitive terraform variable to prevent it from being
   displayed in plain text in the terraform state.

```hcl
variable "artifactory_access_token" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

module "jfrog" {
  source = "registry.coder.com/modules/jfrog-token/coder"
  version = "1.0.0"
  agent_id = coder_agent.example.id
  jfrog_url = "https://example.jfrog.io"
  configure_code_server = true # this depends on the code-server
  artifactory_access_token = var.artifactory_access_token
  package_managers = {
    "npm": "npm",
    "go": "go",
    "pypi": "pypi"
  }
}
```

<blockquote class="info">
The admin-level access token is used to provision user tokens and is never exposed to
developers or stored in workspaces.

If you do not want to use the official modules, you can check example template
that uses Docker as the underlying compute
[here](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/examples/jfrog/docker). The same
concepts apply to all compute types.

## Offline Deployments

See the [offline deployments](../install/offline.md#coder-modules) section for
instructions on how to use coder-modules in an offline environment with
Artifactory.
