## Setting up a Coder deployment [DEPRECATED]

For day-zero Coder users, we recommend following this guide to set up a local
Coder deployment from our
[open source repository](https://github.com/coder/coder).

We'll use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine) to manage the compute for a
slim deployment to experiment with
[workpsaces](../tutorials/workspaces/README.md) and
[templates](../tutorials/templates/README.md).

Docker is not necessary for every Coder deployment and is only used here for
simplicity.

### Install Coder daemon

First, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) locally.

> If you already have the Coder binary installed, restart it after installing
> Docker.

## Linux/macOS

Our install script is the fastest way to install Coder on Linux/macOS:

```sh
curl -L https://coder.com/install.sh | sh
```

## Windows

> **Important:** If you plan to use the built-in PostgreSQL database, you will
> need to ensure that the
> [Visual C++ Runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version)
> is installed.

You can use the
[`winget`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#use-winget)
package manager to install Coder:

```powershell
winget install Coder.Coder
```

</div>

### Start the server

To start or restart the Coder deployment, use the following command:

```shell
coder server
```

The output will provide you with an access URL to create your first
administrator account.

Once you've signed in, you'll be brought to an empty workspaces page, which
we'll soon populate with your first development environments.
