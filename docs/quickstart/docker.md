# Docker

Coder with Docker has the following advantages:

- Simple installation (everything is on a single box)
- Workspace images are easily configured
- Workspaces share resources for burst operations

## Requirements

- A single MacOS or Linux box
- A running Docker daemon

## Instructions

1.  [Install and launch Coder](../install.md)

    You will specify `CODER_ACCESS_URL=http://localhost:7080` since we're using
    local Docker workspaces exclusively. `CODER_ACCESS_URL` is the external URL
    to access Coder. The rest of the Docker quickstart guide will assume that
    this is your Access URL.

    You will also specify `CODER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7080` which is the address to
    serve the API and dashboard.

    ```bash
    coder server --address $CODER_ADDRESS --access-url $CODER_ACCESS_URL
    ```

1.  Run `coder login http://localhost:7080` in a new terminal and follow the
    interactive instructions to create your user.

1.  Pull the example template:

    ```bash
    echo "docker" | coder templates init
    cd docker
    # You should see a `main.tf` file in this directory
    ```

1.  Open up `main.tf` in your preferred editor to edit the images

    You can skip this step if you're fine with our default, generic OS images.

    Search for the following section in `main.tf`:

    ```hcl
    ...
    variable "docker_image" {
     description = "Which Docker image would you like to use for your workspace?"
     # The codercom/enterprise-* images are only built for amd64
     default = "codercom/enterprise-base:ubuntu"
     validation {
         condition     = contains(["codercom/enterprise-base:ubuntu", "codercom/enterprise-node:ubuntu",
                                 "codercom/enterprise-intellij:ubuntu", "codercom/enterprise-golang:ubuntu"], var.docker_image)
         error_message = "Invalid Docker image!"
     }
    }
    ...
    ```

    And edit the strings in `condition = contains([...])` and `default = ...`
    with your preferred images.

1.  Push up the template to Coder with `coder templates create`
1.  Open the dashboard in your browser (http://localhost:7080) to create your
    first workspace:

    <img src="../images/quickstart/docker/login.png">

    Then navigate to `Templates > docker > Create workspace`

    <img src="../images/quickstart/docker/create-workspace.png">

    Now wait a few moments for the workspace to build... After the first build
    the image is cached and subsequent builds will take a few seconds.

1.  All done!

    Open up a web application or [SSH in](../ides.md#ssh-configuration).
