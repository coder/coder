# JetBrains Gateway in an air-gapped environment

In networks that restrict access to the internet, you will need to leverage the
JetBrains Client Installer to download and save the IDE clients locally. Please
see the
[JetBrains documentation for more information](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/fully-offline-mode.html).

This page is an example that the Coder team used as a proof-of-concept (POC) of the JetBrains Gateway Offline Mode solution.

We used Ubuntu on a virtual machine to test the steps.
If you have a suggestion or encounter an issue, please
[file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/coder/coder/issues/new?title=request%28docs%29%3A+jetbrains-airgapped+-+request+title+here%0D%0A&labels=["community","docs"]&body=doc%3A+%5Bjetbrains-airgapped%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fcoder.com%2Fdocs%2Fuser-guides%2Fworkspace-access%2Fjetbrains%2Fjetbrains-airgapped%29%0D%0A%0D%0Aplease+enter+your+request+here%0D%0A).

## 1. Deploy the server and install the Client Downloader

Install the JetBrains Client Downloader binary. Note that the server must be a Linux-based distribution:

```shell
wget https://download.jetbrains.com/idea/code-with-me/backend/jetbrains-clients-downloader-linux-x86_64-1867.tar.gz && \
tar -xzvf jetbrains-clients-downloader-linux-x86_64-1867.tar.gz
```

## 2. Install backends and clients

JetBrains Gateway requires both a backend to be installed on the remote host
(your Coder workspace) and a client to be installed on your local machine. You
can host both on the server in this example.

See here for the full
[JetBrains product list and builds](https://data.services.jetbrains.com/products).
Below is the full list of supported `--platforms-filter` values:

```console
windows-x64, windows-aarch64, linux-x64, linux-aarch64, osx-x64, osx-aarch64
```

To install both backends and clients, you will need to run two commands.

### Backends

```shell
mkdir ~/backends
./jetbrains-clients-downloader-linux-x86_64-1867/bin/jetbrains-clients-downloader --products-filter <product-code> --build-filter <build-number> --platforms-filter linux-x64,windows-x64,osx-x64 --download-backends ~/backends
```

### Clients

This is the same command as above, with the `--download-backends` flag removed.

```shell
mkdir ~/clients
./jetbrains-clients-downloader-linux-x86_64-1867/bin/jetbrains-clients-downloader --products-filter <product-code> --build-filter <build-number> --platforms-filter linux-x64,windows-x64,osx-x64 ~/clients
```

We now have both clients and backends installed.

## 3. Install a web server

You will need to run a web server in order to serve requests to the backend and
client files. We installed `nginx` and setup an FQDN and routed all requests to
`/`. See below:

```console
server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        root /var/www/html;

        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name _;

        location / {
                root /home/ubuntu;
        }
}
```

Then, configure your DNS entry to point to the IP address of the server. For the
purposes of the POC, we did not configure TLS, although that is a supported
option.

## 4. Add Client Files

You will need to add the following files on your local machine in order for
Gateway to pull the backend and client from the server.

```shell
$ cat productsInfoUrl # a path to products.json that was generated by the backend's downloader (it could be http://, https://, or file://)

https://internal.site/backends/<PRODUCT_CODE>/products.json

$ cat clientDownloadUrl # a path for clients that you got from the clients' downloader (it could be http://, https://, or file://)

https://internal.site/clients/

$ cat jreDownloadUrl # a path for JBR that you got from the clients' downloader (it could be http://, https://, or file://)

https://internal.site/jre/

$ cat pgpPublicKeyUrl # a URL to the KEYS file that was downloaded with the clients builds.

https://internal.site/KEYS
```

The location of these files will depend upon your local operating system:

<div class="tabs">

### macOS

```console
# User-specific settings
/Users/UserName/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/RemoteDev
# System-wide settings
/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/RemoteDev/
```

### Linux

```console
# User-specific settings
$HOME/.config/JetBrains/RemoteDev
# System-wide settings
/etc/xdg/JetBrains/RemoteDev/
```

### Windows

```console
# User-specific settings
HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry
# System-wide settings
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry
```

Additionally, create a string for each setting with its appropriate value in
`SOFTWARE\JetBrains\RemoteDev`:

![JetBrains offline - Windows](../../../images/gateway/jetbrains-offline-windows.png)

</div>

## 5. Setup SSH connection with JetBrains Gateway

With the server now configured, you can now configure your local machine to use
Gateway. Here is the documentation to
[setup SSH config via the Coder CLI](../../../user-guides/workspace-access/index.md#configure-ssh).
On the Gateway side, follow our guide here until step 16.

Instead of downloading from jetbrains.com, we will point Gateway to our server
endpoint. Select `Installation options...` and select `Use download link`. Note
that the URL must explicitly reference the archive file:

![Offline Gateway](../../../images/gateway/offline-gateway.png)

Click `Download IDE and Connect`. Gateway should now download the backend and
clients from the server into your remote workspace and local machine,
respectively.
