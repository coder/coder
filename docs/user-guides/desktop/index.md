# Coder Desktop

Coder Desktop provides seamless access to your remote workspaces through a native application. Connect to workspace services using simple hostnames like `myworkspace.coder`, launch applications with one click, and synchronize files between local and remote environments—all without installing a CLI or configuring manual port forwarding.

## What You'll Need

- A Coder deployment running `v2.20.0` or [later](https://github.com/coder/coder/releases/latest)
- Administrator privileges on your local machine (for VPN extension installation)
- Access to your Coder deployment URL

## Quick Start

1. Install: `brew install --cask coder/coder/coder-desktop` (macOS) or `winget install Coder.CoderDesktop` (Windows)
1. Open Coder Desktop and approve any system prompts to complete the installation.
1. Sign in with your deployment URL and session token
1. Enable "Coder Connect" toggle
1. Access workspaces at `workspace-name.coder`

## How It Works

**Coder Connect**, the primary component of Coder Desktop, creates a secure tunnel to your Coder deployment, allowing you to:

- **Access workspaces directly**: Connect via `workspace-name.coder` hostnames
- **Use any application**: SSH clients, browsers, IDEs work seamlessly
- **Sync files**: Bidirectional sync between local and remote directories
- **Work offline**: Edit files locally, sync when reconnected

The VPN extension routes only Coder traffic—your other internet activity remains unchanged.

## Testing Your Connection

Once connected, test access to your workspaces:

<div class="tabs">

### SSH Connection

```shell
ssh your-workspace.coder
```

### Ping Test

```shell
# macOS
ping6 -c 3 your-workspace.coder

# Windows
ping -n 3 your-workspace.coder
```

### Web Services

Open `http://your-workspace.coder:PORT` in your browser, replacing `PORT` with the specific service port you want to access (e.g. 3000 for frontend, 8080 for API)

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

#### Can't connect to workspace

- Verify Coder Connect is enabled (toggle should be ON)
- Check that your deployment URL is correct
- Ensure your session token hasn't expired
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting Coder Connect

#### VPN extension not working

- Restart Coder Desktop
- Check system permissions for network extensions
- Ensure only one copy of Coder Desktop is installed
