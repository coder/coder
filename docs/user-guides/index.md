# User Guides

These guides contain information on workspace management, workspace access via
IDEs, environment personalization, and workspace scheduling.

These are intended for end-user flows only. If you are an administrator, please
refer to our docs on configuring [templates](../admin/index.md) or the
[control plane](../admin/index.md).

Check out our [early access features](../early-access/index.md) for upcoming
functionality, including the new
[Dev Containers integration](../early-access/devcontainers.md).
