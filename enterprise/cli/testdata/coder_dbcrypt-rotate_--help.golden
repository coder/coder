      --postgres-url string, $CODER_PG_CONNECTION_URL
          URL of a PostgreSQL database. If empty, PostgreSQL binaries will be
          downloaded from Maven (https://repo1.maven.org/maven2) and store all
          data in the config root. Access the built-in database with "coder
          server postgres-builtin-url".

      --external-token-encryption-keys string-array, $CODER_EXTERNAL_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEYS
          Encrypt OIDC and Git authentication tokens with AES-256-GCM in the
          database. The value must be a comma-separated list of base64-encoded
          keys. Each key, when base64-decoded, must be exactly 32 bytes in
          length. The first key will be used to encrypt new values. Subsequent
          keys will be used as a fallback when decrypting. During normal
          operation it is recommended to only set one key.
