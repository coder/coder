GLOBAL OPTIONS: 
Global options are applied to all commands. They can be set using environment
variables or flags.

      --debug-options bool
          Print all options, how they're set, then exit.

      --disable-direct-connections bool, $CODER_DISABLE_DIRECT_CONNECTIONS
          Disable direct (P2P) connections to workspaces.

      --disable-network-telemetry bool, $CODER_DISABLE_NETWORK_TELEMETRY
          Disable network telemetry. Network telemetry is collected when
          connecting to workspaces using the CLI, and is forwarded to the
          server. If telemetry is also enabled on the server, it may be sent to
          Coder. Network telemetry is used to measure network quality and detect
          regressions.

      --global-config string, $CODER_CONFIG_DIR (default: ~/.config/coderv2)
          Path to the global `coder` config directory.

      --header string-array, $CODER_HEADER
          Additional HTTP headers added to all requests. Provide as key=value.
          Can be specified multiple times.

      --header-command string, $CODER_HEADER_COMMAND
          An external command that outputs additional HTTP headers added to all
          requests. The command must output each header as `key=value` on its
          own line.

      --no-feature-warning bool, $CODER_NO_FEATURE_WARNING
          Suppress warnings about unlicensed features.

      --no-version-warning bool, $CODER_NO_VERSION_WARNING
          Suppress warning when client and server versions do not match.

      --token string, $CODER_SESSION_TOKEN
          Specify an authentication token. For security reasons setting
          CODER_SESSION_TOKEN is preferred.

      --url url, $CODER_URL
          URL to a deployment.

  -v, --verbose bool, $CODER_VERBOSE
          Enable verbose output.
