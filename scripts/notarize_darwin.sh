# This script notarizes the provided zip file using an Apple Developer account.
#
# Usage: ./notarize_darwin.sh path/to/zipfile.zip
#
# The provided zip file must contain a coder binary that has already been signed
# using ./sign_darwin.sh.
#
# On success, all of the contained binaries inside the input zip file will
# notarized. This does not make any changes to the zip or contained files
# itself, but GateKeeper checks will pass for the binaries inside the zip file
# as long as the device is connected to the internet to download the
# notarization ticket from Apple.
#
# You can check if a binary is notarized by running the following command on a
# Mac:
#   spctl --assess -vvv -t install path/to/binary
#
# Depends on the rcodesign utility. Requires the following environment variables
# to be set:
#  - $AC_APIKEY_ISSUER_ID: The issuer UUID of the Apple App Store Connect API
#    key.
#  - $AC_APIKEY_ID: The key ID of the Apple App Store Connect API key.
#  - $AC_APIKEY_FILE: The path to the private key P8 file of the Apple App Store
#    Connect API key.
