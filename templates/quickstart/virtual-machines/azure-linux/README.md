To get started, run `coder templates init`. When prompted, select this template.
Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed.

## Authentication

This template assumes that coderd is run in an environment that is authenticated
with Azure. For example, run `az login` then `az account set --subscription=<id>`
to import credentials on the system and user running coderd.  For other ways to
authenticate [consult the Terraform docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#authenticating-to-azure).
