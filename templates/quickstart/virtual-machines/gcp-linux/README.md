# gcp-linux

To get started, run `coder templates init`. When prompted, select this template,
and follow the on-screen instructions to proceed.

## Authentication

This template assumes that coderd is run in an environment that is authenticated
with Google Cloud. For example, run `gcloud auth application-default login` to
import credentials on the system and user running coderd.  For other ways to
authenticate [consult the Terraform
docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/getting_started#adding-credentials).

## Service account

Coder requires a Google Cloud Service Account to provision workspaces. To create
a service account:

1. Navigate to the [CGP
   console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create),
   and select your Cloud project (if you have more than one project associated
   with your account)

1. Provide a service account name (this name is used to generate the service
   account ID)

1. Click **Create and continue**, and choose the following IAM roles to grant to
   the service account:
   - Compute Admin
   - Service Account User

   Click **Continue**.

1. Click on the created key, and navigate to the **Keys** tab.

1. Click **Add key** > **Create new key**.

1. Generate a **JSON private key**, which will be what you provide to Coder
   during the setup process.

## code-server

`code-server` is installed via the `startup_script` argument in the `coder_agent`
resource block. The `coder_app` resource is defined to access `code-server` through
the dashboard UI over `localhost:13337`.
