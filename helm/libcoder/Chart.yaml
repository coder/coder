# version and appVersion are injected at release and will always be shown as
# 0.1.0 in the repository.
#
# If you're installing the Helm chart directly from git it will have this
# version, which means the auto-generated image URI will be invalid. You can set
# "coder.image.tag" to the desired tag manually.
