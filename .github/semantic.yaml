# We have no valid scopes right now.
# A scope should be added when commits aren't aligning with associated change anymore.
scopes:

# We only check that the PR title is semantic. The PR title is automatically
# applied to the "Squash & Merge" flow as the suggested commit message, so this
# should suffice unless someone drastically alters the message in that flow.
titleOnly: true

# Types are the 'tag' types in a commit or PR title. For example, in
#
# chore: fix thing
#
# 'chore' is the type.
types:
  # A build of any kind.
  - build

  # A RELEASED fix that will NOT be back-ported. The originating issue may have
  # been discovered internally or externally to Coder.
  - fix

  # Any code task that is ignored for changelog purposes. Examples include
  # devbin scripts and internal-only configurations.
  - chore

  # Any work performed on CI.
  - ci

  # An UNRELEASED correction. For example, features are often built
  # incrementally and sometimes introduce minor flaws during a release cycle.
  # Corrections address those increments and flaws.
  - correct

  # Work that directly implements or supports the implementation of a feature.
  - feat

  # A fix for a RELEASED bug (regression fix) that is intended for patch-release
  # purposes.
  - hotfix

  # A refactor changes code structure without any behavioral change.
  - refactor

  # A git revert for any style of commit.
  - revert

  # Adding tests of any kind. Should be separate from feature or fix
  # implementations. For example, if a commit adds a fix + test, it's a fix
  # commit. If a commit is simply bumping coverage, it's a test commit.
  - test
