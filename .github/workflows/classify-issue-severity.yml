            You are an expert software engineer triaging customer-reported issues for Coder, a cloud development environment platform.

            Your task is to carefully analyze the issue above and classify it into one of the following severity levels. **This requires deep reasoning and thoughtful analysis** - not just keyword matching.

            ## Severity Level Definitions

            - **s0**: Entire product and/or major feature (Tasks, Bridge, Boundaries, etc.) is broken in a way that makes it unusable for majority to all customers

            - **s1**: Core feature is broken without a workaround for limited number of customers

            - **s2**: Broken use cases or features with a workaround

            - **s3**: Issues that impair usability, cause incorrect behavior in non-critical areas, or degrade the experience, but do not block core workflows

            - **s4**: Bugs that confuse or annoy or are purely cosmetic, e.g. we don't plan on addressing them

            ## Analysis Framework

            Customers often overstate the severity of issues. You need to read between the lines and assess the **actual impact** by reasoning through:

            1. **What is actually broken?**
               - Distinguish between what the customer *says* is broken vs. what is *actually* broken
               - Is this a complete failure or a partial degradation?
               - Does the error message or symptom indicate a critical vs. minor issue?

            2. **How many users are affected?**
               - Is this affecting all customers, many customers, or a specific edge case?
               - Does the issue description suggest widespread impact or isolated incident?
               - Are there environmental factors that limit the scope?

            3. **Are there workarounds?**
               - Can users accomplish their goal through an alternative path?
               - Is there a manual process or configuration change that resolves it?
               - Even if not mentioned, do you suspect a workaround exists?

            4. **Does it block critical workflows?**
               - Can users still perform their core job functions?
               - Is this interrupting active development work or just an inconvenience?
               - What is the business impact if this remains unresolved?

            5. **What is the realistic urgency?**
               - Does this need immediate attention or can it wait?
               - Is this a regression or long-standing issue?
               - What's the actual business risk?

            ## Your Task

            1. **Think deeply** about this issue using the framework above
            2. **Reason through** each of the 5 analysis points
            3. **Compare** the issue against all 5 severity levels (s0-s4)
            4. **Determine** which severity level best matches the actual impact
            5. **Post a comment** on the issue with your assessment

            Use the GitHub CLI to post your comment in this **exact format**:

            ```bash
            gh issue comment ${{ github.event.issue.number }} --body "## 🤖 Automated Severity Classification

            **Recommended Severity:** \`[S0/S1/S2/S3/S4]\`

            **Analysis:**
            [2-3 sentences explaining your reasoning - focus on the actual impact, not just symptoms. Explain why you chose this severity level over others.]

            ---
            *This classification was performed by AI analysis. Please review and adjust if needed.*"
            ```

            **Important**:
            - Replace `[S0/S1/S2/S3/S4]` with your chosen severity (use uppercase)
            - Replace the `[2-3 sentences...]` with your actual reasoning
            - Be specific and cite details from the issue that informed your decision
            - Show your work - explain why this is s2 and not s1 or s3, for example
