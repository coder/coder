# GitHub release workflow.
#
# This workflow is a bit complicated because we have to build darwin binaries on
# a mac runner, but the mac runners are extremely slow. So instead of running
# the entire release on a mac (which will take an hour to run), we run only the
# mac build on a mac, and the rest on a linux runner. The final release is then
# published using a final linux runner.
