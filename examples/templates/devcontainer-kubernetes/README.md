# Remote Development on Kubernetes Pods (with Devcontainers)

Provision Kubernetes Pods as [Coder workspaces](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/workspaces) with this example template.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->

## Prerequisites

### Infrastructure

**Cluster**: This template requires an existing Kubernetes cluster

**Container Image**: This template uses the [codercom/enterprise-base:ubuntu image](https://github.com/coder/enterprise-images/tree/main/images/base) with some dev tools preinstalled. To add additional tools, extend this image or build it yourself.

### Authentication

This template authenticates using a `~/.kube/config`, if present on the server, or via built-in authentication if the Coder provisioner is running on Kubernetes with an authorized ServiceAccount. To use another [authentication method](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs#authentication), edit the template.

## Architecture

Coder supports devcontainers with [envbuilder](https://github.com/coder/envbuilder), an open source project. Read more about this in [Coder's documentation](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/templates/dev-containers).

This template provisions the following resources:

- Kubernetes pod (ephemeral)
- Kubernetes persistent volume claim (persistent on `/home/coder`)

This means, when the workspace restarts, any tools or files outside of the home directory are not persisted. To pre-bake tools into the workspace (e.g. `python3`), modify the container image. Alternatively, individual developers can [personalize](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/dotfiles) their workspaces with dotfiles.

> **Note**
> This template is designed to be a starting point! Edit the Terraform to extend the template to support your use case.
