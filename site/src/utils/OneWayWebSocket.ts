/**
 * @file A WebSocket that can only receive messages from the server, and cannot
 * ever send anything.
 *
 * This should ALWAYS be favored in favor of using Server-Sent Events and the
 * built-in EventSource class for doing one-way communication. SSEs have a hard
 * limitation on HTTP/1.1 and below where there is a maximum number of 6 ports
 * that can ever be used for a domain (sometimes less depending on the browser).
 * Not only is this limit shared with short-lived REST requests, but it also
 * applies across tabs and windows. So if a user opens Coder in multiple tabs,
 * there is a very real possibility that parts of the app will start to lock up
 * without it being clear why.
 *
 * WebSockets do not have this limitation, even on HTTP/1.1 â€“ all modern
 * browsers implement at least some degree of multiplexing for them. This file
 * just provides a wrapper to make it harder to use WebSockets for two-way
 * communication by accident.
