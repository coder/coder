/**
 * @todo Things that still need to be done before this can be called done:
 * 1. Explore an idea for handling selectors without forcing someone to specify
 *    data dependencies for what values are accessed via closure:
 *    - A selector is ALWAYS run synchronously in a render. There is no way to
 *      opt out of this behavior, not even memoization
 *    - The selector is still used to determine whether a component should
 *      re-render via a time update. It will be assumed that whatever function
 *      is currently available will always be the most up-to-date
 *    - This approach might make it more viable to combine useTimeSync and
 *      useTimeSyncSelector again
 * 2. Add tests and address any bugs
