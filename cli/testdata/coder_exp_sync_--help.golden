USAGE:

  Manage unit dependencies for coordinated startup

  Commands for orchestrating unit startup order in workspaces. Units are most
  commonly coder scripts. Use these commands to declare dependencies between
  units, coordinate their startup sequence, and ensure units start only after
  their dependencies are ready. This helps prevent race conditions and startup
  failures.

SUBCOMMANDS:
    complete    Mark a unit as complete
    ping        Test agent socket connectivity and health
    start       Wait until all unit dependencies are satisfied
    status      Show unit status and dependency state
    want        Declare that a unit depends on another unit completing before it
                can start

OPTIONS:
      --socket-path string, $CODER_AGENT_SOCKET_PATH
          Specify the path for the agent socket.
