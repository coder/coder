                              email and password and adds it to every
                              organization.
    postgres-builtin-serve    Run the built-in PostgreSQL deployment.
    postgres-builtin-url      Output the connection URL for the built-in
                              PostgreSQL deployment.
[1mOptions[0m
      --cache-dir, $CODER_CACHE_DIRECTORY (default: ~/.cache/coder)

          debugging, but may result in a very large amount of events being sent
          to the tracing backend which may incur significant costs. If the
          verbose flag was supplied, debug-level logs will be included.

      --trace, $CODER_TRACE_ENABLE
          Whether application tracing data is collected. It exports to a backend

          the form "*.example.com".

[1mNetworking / DERP Options[0m 
Most Coder deployments never have to think about DERP because all connections
between workspaces and users are peer-to-peer. However, when Coder cannot
establish a peer to peer connection, Coder uses a distributed relay network
backed by Tailscale and WireGuard.

      --derp-config-path, $CODER_DERP_CONFIG_PATH
          Path to read a DERP mapping from. See:
          https://tailscale.com/kb/1118/custom-derp-servers/.

      --derp-config-url, $CODER_DERP_CONFIG_URL
          URL to fetch a DERP mapping on startup. See:
          https://tailscale.com/kb/1118/custom-derp-servers/.

      --derp-server-enable, $CODER_DERP_SERVER_ENABLE (default: true)
          Whether to enable or disable the embedded DERP relay server.

      --derp-server-region-code, $CODER_DERP_SERVER_REGION_CODE (default: coder)
          Region code to use for the embedded DERP server.

          disable P2P connections.

[1mNetworking / HTTP Options[0m 
      --disable-password-auth, $CODER_DISABLE_PASSWORD_AUTH (default: false)
          Disable password authentication. This is recommended for security
          purposes in production deployments that rely on an identity provider.
          Any user with the owner role will be able to sign in with their
          password regardless of this setting to avoid potential lock out. If
          you are locked out of your account, you can use the `coder server
          create-admin` command to create a new admin user directly in the
          database.

      --disable-session-expiry-refresh, $CODER_DISABLE_SESSION_EXPIRY_REFRESH (default: false)
          Disable automatic session expiry bumping due to activity. This forces
          all sessions to become invalid after the session expiry duration has
          been reached.

      --http-address, $CODER_HTTP_ADDRESS (default: 127.0.0.1:3000)
          HTTP bind address of the server. Unset to disable the HTTP endpoint.

      --max-token-lifetime, $CODER_MAX_TOKEN_LIFETIME (default: 2562047h47m16.854775807s)
          The maximum lifetime duration users can specify when creating an API
          token.

      --session-duration, $CODER_SESSION_DURATION (default: 24h0m0s)
          The token expiry duration for browser sessions. Sessions may last
          longer if they are actively making requests, but this functionality
          can be disabled via --disable-session-expiry-refresh.

          configure the listener to use a CA certificate, concatenate the
          primary certificate and the CA certificate together. The primary
          certificate should appear first in the combined file.

      --tls-client-auth, $CODER_TLS_CLIENT_AUTH (default: none)
          Policy the server will follow for TLS Client Authentication. Accepted
          values are "none", "request", "require-any", "verify-if-given", or
