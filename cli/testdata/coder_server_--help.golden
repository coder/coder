[1mSubcommands[0m
    create-admin-user         Create a new admin user with the given username,
                              email and password and adds it to every
                              organization.
    postgres-builtin-serve    Run the built-in PostgreSQL deployment.
    postgres-builtin-url      Output the connection URL for the built-in
                              PostgreSQL deployment.

[1mOptions[0m
      --cache-dir string, $CODER_CACHE_DIRECTORY (default: [cache dir])
          The directory to cache temporary files. If unspecified and
          $CACHE_DIRECTORY is set, it will be used for compatibility with
          systemd.

      --disable-owner-workspace-access bool, $CODER_DISABLE_OWNER_WORKSPACE_ACCESS
          Remove the permission for the 'owner' role to have workspace execution
          on all workspaces. This prevents the 'owner' from ssh, apps, and
          terminal access based on the 'owner' role. They still have their user
          permissions to access their own workspaces.

      --disable-path-apps bool, $CODER_DISABLE_PATH_APPS
          Disable workspace apps that are not served from subdomains. Path-based
          apps can make requests to the Coder API and pose a security risk when
          the workspace serves malicious JavaScript. This is recommended for
          security purposes if a --wildcard-access-url is configured.

      --swagger-enable bool, $CODER_SWAGGER_ENABLE
          Expose the swagger endpoint via /swagger.

      --experiments string-array, $CODER_EXPERIMENTS
          Enable one or more experiments. These are not ready for production.

          all available experiments.

      --postgres-url string, $CODER_PG_CONNECTION_URL
          URL of a PostgreSQL database. If empty, PostgreSQL binaries will be
          downloaded from Maven (https://repo1.maven.org/maven2) and store all
          data in the config root. Access the built-in database with "coder
          server postgres-builtin-url".

      --ssh-keygen-algorithm string, $CODER_SSH_KEYGEN_ALGORITHM (default: ed25519)
          The algorithm to use for generating ssh keys. Accepted values are

[1mIntrospection / Tracing Options[0m 
      --trace-logs bool, $CODER_TRACE_LOGS
          Enables capturing of logs as events in traces. This is useful for
          debugging, but may result in a very large amount of events being sent
          to the tracing backend which may incur significant costs.

      --trace bool, $CODER_TRACE_ENABLE
          Whether application tracing data is collected. It exports to a backend
          configured by environment variables. See:
          https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/exporter.md.

          True-Client-Ip, X-Forwarded-For.

      --proxy-trusted-origins string-array, $CODER_PROXY_TRUSTED_ORIGINS
          Origin addresses to respect "proxy-trusted-headers". e.g.
          192.168.1.0/24.

      --redirect-to-access-url bool, $CODER_REDIRECT_TO_ACCESS_URL
          Specifies whether to redirect requests that do not match the access
          URL host.

      --secure-auth-cookie bool, $CODER_SECURE_AUTH_COOKIE
          Controls if the 'Secure' property is set on browser session cookies.

      --wildcard-access-url url, $CODER_WILDCARD_ACCESS_URL
          Specifies the wildcard hostname to use for workspace applications in
          the form "*.example.com".

[1mNetworking / DERP Options[0m 
Most Coder deployments never have to think about DERP because all connections
between workspaces and users are peer-to-peer. However, when Coder cannot
establish a peer to peer connection, Coder uses a distributed relay network
backed by Tailscale and WireGuard.

      --block-direct-connections bool, $CODER_BLOCK_DIRECT
          Block peer-to-peer (aka. direct) workspace connections. All workspace
          connections from the CLI will be proxied through Coder (or custom
          configured DERP servers) and will never be peer-to-peer when enabled.
          Workspaces may still reach out to STUN servers to get their address
          until they are restarted after this change has been made, but new
          connections will still be proxied regardless.

      --derp-config-path string, $CODER_DERP_CONFIG_PATH
          Path to read a DERP mapping from. See:
          https://tailscale.com/kb/1118/custom-derp-servers/.

      --derp-config-url string, $CODER_DERP_CONFIG_URL
          URL to fetch a DERP mapping on startup. See:
          https://tailscale.com/kb/1118/custom-derp-servers/.

      --derp-force-websockets bool, $CODER_DERP_FORCE_WEBSOCKETS
          Force clients and agents to always use WebSocket to connect to DERP
          relay servers. By default, DERP uses `Upgrade: derp`, which may cause
          issues with some reverse proxies. Clients may automatically fallback
          to WebSocket if they detect an issue with `Upgrade: derp`, but this
          does not work in all situations.

      --derp-server-enable bool, $CODER_DERP_SERVER_ENABLE (default: true)
          Whether to enable or disable the embedded DERP relay server.

      --derp-server-region-name string, $CODER_DERP_SERVER_REGION_NAME (default: Coder Embedded Relay)
          Region name that for the embedded DERP server.

      --derp-server-stun-addresses string-array, $CODER_DERP_SERVER_STUN_ADDRESSES (default: stun.l.google.com:19302,stun1.l.google.com:19302,stun2.l.google.com:19302,stun3.l.google.com:19302,stun4.l.google.com:19302)
          Addresses for STUN servers to establish P2P connections. It's
          recommended to have at least two STUN servers to give users the best
          chance of connecting P2P to workspaces. Each STUN server will get it's
          own DERP region, with region IDs starting at `--derp-server-region-id
          + 1`. Use special value 'disable' to turn off STUN completely.

[1mNetworking / HTTP Options[0m 
      --disable-password-auth bool, $CODER_DISABLE_PASSWORD_AUTH
          Disable password authentication. This is recommended for security
          purposes in production deployments that rely on an identity provider.
          Any user with the owner role will be able to sign in with their
          password regardless of this setting to avoid potential lock out. If
          you are locked out of your account, you can use the `coder server
          create-admin` command to create a new admin user directly in the
          database.

      --disable-session-expiry-refresh bool, $CODER_DISABLE_SESSION_EXPIRY_REFRESH
          Disable automatic session expiry bumping due to activity. This forces
          all sessions to become invalid after the session expiry duration has
          been reached.

      --http-address string, $CODER_HTTP_ADDRESS (default: 127.0.0.1:3000)
          HTTP bind address of the server. Unset to disable the HTTP endpoint.

      --max-token-lifetime duration, $CODER_MAX_TOKEN_LIFETIME (default: 876600h0m0s)
          The maximum lifetime duration users can specify when creating an API
          token.

      --proxy-health-interval duration, $CODER_PROXY_HEALTH_INTERVAL (default: 1m0s)
          The interval in which coderd should be checking the status of
          workspace proxies.

      --session-duration duration, $CODER_SESSION_DURATION (default: 24h0m0s)
          The token expiry duration for browser sessions. Sessions may last
          longer if they are actively making requests, but this functionality
          can be disabled via --disable-session-expiry-refresh.

[1mNetworking / TLS Options[0m 
Configure TLS / HTTPS for your Coder deployment. If you're running Coder behind
a TLS-terminating reverse proxy or are accessing Coder over a secure link, you
can safely ignore these settings.

          configure the listener to use a CA certificate, concatenate the
          primary certificate and the CA certificate together. The primary
          certificate should appear first in the combined file.

      --tls-client-auth string, $CODER_TLS_CLIENT_AUTH (default: none)
          Policy the server will follow for TLS Client Authentication. Accepted
          values are "none", "request", "require-any", "verify-if-given", or

          in queued state for a long time, consider increasing this.

[1mTelemetry Options[0m 
Telemetry is critical to our ability to improve Coder. We strip all
personalinformation before sending data to our servers. Please only disable
telemetrywhen required by your organization's security policy.

      --telemetry bool, $CODER_TELEMETRY_ENABLE (default: false)
          Whether telemetry is enabled or not. Coder collects anonymized usage
          data to help improve our product.

      --telemetry-trace bool, $CODER_TELEMETRY_TRACE (default: false)
          Whether Opentelemetry traces are sent to Coder. Coder collects
          anonymized application tracing to help improve our product. Disabling
          telemetry also disables this option.

[1mUser Quiet Hours Schedule Options[0m

workspaces stopping during the day due to template max TTL.

      --default-quiet-hours-schedule string, $CODER_QUIET_HOURS_DEFAULT_SCHEDULE
          The default daily cron schedule applied to users that haven't set a
          custom quiet hours schedule themselves. The quiet hours schedule
          determines when workspaces will be force stopped due to the template's
          max TTL, and will round the max TTL up to be within the user's quiet
          hours window (or default). The format is the same as the standard cron
          format, but the day-of-month, month and day-of-week must be *. Only
          one hour and minute can be specified (ranges or comma separated values
          are not supported).

[1m⚠️ Dangerous Options[0m 
      --dangerous-allow-path-app-sharing bool, $CODER_DANGEROUS_ALLOW_PATH_APP_SHARING
          Allow workspace apps that are not served from subdomains to be shared.
          Path-based app sharing is DISABLED by default for security purposes.
          Path-based apps can make requests to the Coder API and pose a security
          risk when the workspace serves malicious JavaScript. Path-based apps
          can be disabled entirely with --disable-path-apps for further
          security.

      --dangerous-allow-path-app-site-owner-access bool, $CODER_DANGEROUS_ALLOW_PATH_APP_SITE_OWNER_ACCESS
          Allow site-owners to access workspace apps from workspaces they do not
          own. Owners cannot access path-based apps they do not own by default.
          Path-based apps can make requests to the Coder API and pose a security
          risk when the workspace serves malicious JavaScript. Path-based apps
          can be disabled entirely with --disable-path-apps for further
          security.

These options are only available in the Enterprise Edition.

      --browser-only bool, $CODER_BROWSER_ONLY
          Whether Coder only allows connections to workspaces via the browser.

      --derp-server-relay-url url, $CODER_DERP_SERVER_RELAY_URL
          An HTTP URL that is accessible by other replicas to relay DERP
          traffic. Required for high availability.

      --external-token-encryption-keys string-array, $CODER_EXTERNAL_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEYS
          Encrypt OIDC and Git authentication tokens with AES-256-GCM in the
          database. The value must be a comma-separated list of base64-encoded
          keys. Each key, when base64-decoded, must be exactly 32 bytes in
          length. The first key will be used to encrypt new values. Subsequent
          keys will be used as a fallback when decrypting. During normal
          operation it is recommended to only set one key unless you are in the
          process of rotating keys with the `coder server dbcrypt rotate`
          command.

      --scim-auth-header string, $CODER_SCIM_AUTH_HEADER
          Enables SCIM and sets the authentication header for the built-in SCIM
          server. New users are automatically created with OIDC authentication.
