[1mSubcommands[0m
    create-admin-user         Create a new admin user with the given username,
                              email and password and adds it to every
                              organization.
    postgres-builtin-serve    Run the built-in PostgreSQL deployment.
    postgres-builtin-url      Output the connection URL for the built-in
                              PostgreSQL deployment.

[1mOptions[0m
      --cache-dir string, $CODER_CACHE_DIRECTORY (default: [cache dir])
          The directory to cache temporary files. If unspecified and
          $CACHE_DIRECTORY is set, it will be used for compatibility with
          systemd.

      --disable-owner-workspace-access bool, $CODER_DISABLE_OWNER_WORKSPACE_ACCESS
          Remove the permission for the 'owner' role to have workspace execution
          on all workspaces. This prevents the 'owner' from ssh, apps, and
          terminal access based on the 'owner' role. They still have their user
          permissions to access their own workspaces.

      --disable-path-apps bool, $CODER_DISABLE_PATH_APPS
          Disable workspace apps that are not served from subdomains. Path-based
          apps can make requests to the Coder API and pose a security risk when
          the workspace serves malicious JavaScript. This is recommended for
          security purposes if a --wildcard-access-url is configured.

      --swagger-enable bool, $CODER_SWAGGER_ENABLE
          Expose the swagger endpoint via /swagger.

      --experiments string-array, $CODER_EXPERIMENTS
          Enable one or more experiments. These are not ready for production.

          all available experiments.

      --postgres-url string, $CODER_PG_CONNECTION_URL
          URL of a PostgreSQL database. If empty, PostgreSQL binaries will be
          downloaded from Maven (https://repo1.maven.org/maven2) and store all
          data in the config root. Access the built-in database with "coder
          server postgres-builtin-url".

      --ssh-keygen-algorithm string, $CODER_SSH_KEYGEN_ALGORITHM (default: ed25519)
          The algorithm to use for generating ssh keys. Accepted values are
          "ed25519", "ecdsa", or "rsa4096".

      --update-check bool, $CODER_UPDATE_CHECK (default: false)
          Periodically check for new releases of Coder and inform the owner. The
          check is performed once per day.

          debugging, but may result in a very large amount of events being sent
          to the tracing backend which may incur significant costs. If the
          verbose flag was supplied, debug-level logs will be included.

      --trace bool, $CODER_TRACE_ENABLE
          Whether application tracing data is collected. It exports to a backend
          configured by environment variables. See:

      --redirect-to-access-url bool, $CODER_REDIRECT_TO_ACCESS_URL
          Specifies whether to redirect requests that do not match the access
          URL host.

      --secure-auth-cookie bool, $CODER_SECURE_AUTH_COOKIE
          Controls if the 'Secure' property is set on browser session cookies.

      --wildcard-access-url url, $CODER_WILDCARD_ACCESS_URL
          Specifies the wildcard hostname to use for workspace applications in
          the form "*.example.com".

[1mNetworking / DERP Options[0m 
Most Coder deployments never have to think about DERP because all connections
between workspaces and users are peer-to-peer. However, when Coder cannot
establish a peer to peer connection, Coder uses a distributed relay network
backed by Tailscale and WireGuard.

      --block-direct-connections bool, $CODER_BLOCK_DIRECT
          Block peer-to-peer (aka. direct) workspace connections. All workspace
          connections from the CLI will be proxied through Coder (or custom
          configured DERP servers) and will never be peer-to-peer when enabled.
          Workspaces may still reach out to STUN servers to get their address
          until they are restarted after this change has been made, but new
          connections will still be proxied regardless.

      --derp-config-path string, $CODER_DERP_CONFIG_PATH
          Path to read a DERP mapping from. See:
          https://tailscale.com/kb/1118/custom-derp-servers/.

          URL to fetch a DERP mapping on startup. See:
          https://tailscale.com/kb/1118/custom-derp-servers/.

      --derp-server-enable bool, $CODER_DERP_SERVER_ENABLE (default: true)
          Whether to enable or disable the embedded DERP relay server.

      --derp-server-region-code string, $CODER_DERP_SERVER_REGION_CODE (default: coder)
          Region code to use for the embedded DERP server.

      --derp-server-region-id int, $CODER_DERP_SERVER_REGION_ID (default: 999)
          Region ID to use for the embedded DERP server.

      --derp-server-region-name string, $CODER_DERP_SERVER_REGION_NAME (default: Coder Embedded Relay)

[1mNetworking / HTTP Options[0m 
      --disable-password-auth bool, $CODER_DISABLE_PASSWORD_AUTH
          Disable password authentication. This is recommended for security
          purposes in production deployments that rely on an identity provider.
          Any user with the owner role will be able to sign in with their
          password regardless of this setting to avoid potential lock out. If
          you are locked out of your account, you can use the `coder server
          create-admin` command to create a new admin user directly in the
          database.

      --disable-session-expiry-refresh bool, $CODER_DISABLE_SESSION_EXPIRY_REFRESH
          Disable automatic session expiry bumping due to activity. This forces
          all sessions to become invalid after the session expiry duration has
          been reached.

      --http-address string, $CODER_HTTP_ADDRESS (default: 127.0.0.1:3000)
          HTTP bind address of the server. Unset to disable the HTTP endpoint.

      --max-token-lifetime duration, $CODER_MAX_TOKEN_LIFETIME (default: 876600h0m0s)
          The maximum lifetime duration users can specify when creating an API
          token.

          The interval in which coderd should be checking the status of
          workspace proxies.

      --session-duration duration, $CODER_SESSION_DURATION (default: 24h0m0s)
          The token expiry duration for browser sessions. Sessions may last
          longer if they are actively making requests, but this functionality
          can be disabled via --disable-session-expiry-refresh.

[1mNetworking / TLS Options[0m 
Configure TLS / HTTPS for your Coder deployment. If you're running Coder behind
a TLS-terminating reverse proxy or are accessing Coder over a secure link, you
can safely ignore these settings.

      --strict-transport-security int, $CODER_STRICT_TRANSPORT_SECURITY (default: 0)
          Controls if the 'Strict-Transport-Security' header is set on all
          static file responses. This header should only be set if the server is
          accessed via HTTPS. This value is the MaxAge in seconds of the header.

      --strict-transport-security-options string-array, $CODER_STRICT_TRANSPORT_SECURITY_OPTIONS
          Two optional fields can be set in the Strict-Transport-Security

          configure the listener to use a CA certificate, concatenate the
          primary certificate and the CA certificate together. The primary
          certificate should appear first in the combined file.

      --tls-client-auth string, $CODER_TLS_CLIENT_AUTH (default: none)
          Policy the server will follow for TLS Client Authentication. Accepted
          values are "none", "request", "require-any", "verify-if-given", or
