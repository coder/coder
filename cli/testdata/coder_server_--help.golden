Usage: coder server

Start a Coder server

 Options
 
    --cache-dir, $CACHE_DIRECTORY  (default: ~/.cache/coder) 
    The directory to cache temporary files. If unspecified and $CACHE_DIRECTORY is
    set, it will be used for compatibility with systemd.

    --disable-path-apps, $DISABLE_PATH_APPS  (default: false) 
    Disable workspace apps that are not served from subdomains. Path-based apps can
    make requests to the Coder API and pose a security risk when the workspace
    serves malicious JavaScript. This is recommended for security purposes if a
    --wildcard-access-url is configured.

    --swagger-enable, $SWAGGER_ENABLE  (default: false) 
    Expose the swagger endpoint via /swagger.

    --experiments, $EXPERIMENTS 
    Enable one or more experiments. These are not ready for production. Separate
    multiple experiments with commas, or enter '*' to opt-in to all available
    experiments.

    --postgres-url, $PG_CONNECTION_URL 
    URL of a PostgreSQL database. If empty, PostgreSQL binaries will be downloaded
    from Maven (https://repo1.maven.org/maven2) and store all data in the config
    root. Access the built-in database with "coder server postgres-builtin-url".

    --ssh-keygen-algorithm, $SSH_KEYGEN_ALGORITHM  (default: ed25519) 
    The algorithm to use for generating ssh keys. Accepted values are "ed25519",
    "ecdsa", or "rsa4096".

    Support links to display in the top right drop down menu.

    --update-check, $UPDATE_CHECK  (default: false) 
    Periodically check for new releases of Coder and inform the owner. The check is
    performed once per day.

Introspection / Logging Options 
 
    --log-human, $LOGGING_HUMAN  (default: /dev/stderr) 
    Output human-readable logs to a given file.

    --log-json, $LOGGING_JSON 
    Output JSON logs to a given file.

    Serve prometheus metrics on the address defined by prometheus address.

Introspection / Tracing Options 
 
    --trace-logs, $TRACE_LOGS 
    Enables capturing of logs as events in traces. This is useful for debugging, but
    may result in a very large amount of events being sent to the tracing backend
    which may incur significant costs. If the verbose flag was supplied, debug-level
    logs will be included.

    --trace, $TRACE_ENABLE 
    Whether application tracing data is collected. It exports to a backend
    configured by environment variables. See:
    https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/exporter.md

    --trace-honeycomb-api-key, $TRACE_HONEYCOMB_API_KEY 
    Enables trace exporting to Honeycomb.io using the provided API Key.

Introspection / pprof Options 
 
    --pprof-address, $PPROF_ADDRESS  (default: 127.0.0.1:6060) 
    The bind address to serve pprof.

    --pprof-enable, $PPROF_ENABLE 
    Serve pprof metrics on the address defined by pprof address.

Networking Options 
 
    --access-url, $ACCESS_URL 
    The URL that users will use to access the Coder deployment.

    --wildcard-access-url, $WILDCARD_ACCESS_URL 
    Specifies the wildcard hostname to use for workspace applications in the form
    "*.example.com".

Networking / DERP Options 
Most Coder deployments never have to think about DERP because all connections
between workspaces and users are peer-to-peer. However, when Coder cannot
establish a peer to peer connection, Coder uses a distributed relay network
backed by Tailscale and WireGuard.

    --derp-config-path, $DERP_CONFIG_PATH 
    Path to read a DERP mapping from. See:
    https://tailscale.com/kb/1118/custom-derp-servers/

    --derp-config-url, $DERP_CONFIG_URL 
    URL to fetch a DERP mapping on startup. See:
    https://tailscale.com/kb/1118/custom-derp-servers/

    --derp-server-enable, $DERP_SERVER_ENABLE  (default: true) 
    Whether to enable or disable the embedded DERP relay server.

    Region code to use for the embedded DERP server.

    --derp-server-region-id, $DERP_SERVER_REGION_ID  (default: 999) 
    Region ID to use for the embedded DERP server.

    --derp-server-region-name, $DERP_SERVER_REGION_NAME  (default: Coder Embedded Relay) 
    Region name that for the embedded DERP server.

    --derp-server-stun-addresses, $DERP_SERVER_STUN_ADDRESSES  (default: stun.l.google.com:19302) 
    Addresses for STUN servers to establish P2P connections. Set empty to disable
    P2P connections.

Networking / HTTP Options 
 
    --disable-password-auth, $DISABLE_PASSWORD_AUTH  (default: false) 
    Disable password authentication. This is recommended for security purposes in
    production deployments that rely on an identity provider. Any user with the
    owner role will be able to sign in with their password regardless of this
    setting to avoid potential lock out. If you are locked out of your account, you
    can use the `coder server create-admin` command to create a new admin user
    directly in the database.

    --disable-session-expiry-refresh, $DISABLE_SESSION_EXPIRY_REFRESH  (default: false) 
    Disable automatic session expiry bumping due to activity. This forces all
    sessions to become invalid after the session expiry duration has been reached.

    --http-address, $HTTP_ADDRESS  (default: 127.0.0.1:3000) 
    HTTP bind address of the server. Unset to disable the HTTP endpoint.

    The maximum lifetime duration users can specify when creating an API token.

    --session-duration, $SESSION_DURATION  (default: 24h0m0s) 
    The token expiry duration for browser sessions. Sessions may last longer if they
    are actively making requests, but this functionality can be disabled via
    --disable-session-expiry-refresh.

Networking / TLS Options 
Configure TLS / HTTPS for your Coder deployment. If you're running Coder behind
a TLS-terminating reverse proxy or are accessing Coder over a secure link, you
can safely ignore these settings.

    --strict-transport-security, $STRICT_TRANSPORT_SECURITY  (default: 0) 
    Controls if the 'Strict-Transport-Security' header is set on all static file
    responses. This header should only be set if the server is accessed via HTTPS.
    This value is the MaxAge in seconds of the header.

    --strict-transport-security-options, $STRICT_TRANSPORT_SECURITY_OPTIONS 
    Two optional fields can be set in the Strict-Transport-Security header;
    'includeSubDomains' and 'preload'. The 'strict-transport-security' flag must be
    set to a non-zero value for these options to be used.

    HTTPS bind address of the server.

    --tls-cert-file, $TLS_CERT_FILE 
    Path to each certificate for TLS. It requires a PEM-encoded file. To configure
    the listener to use a CA certificate, concatenate the primary certificate and
    the CA certificate together. The primary certificate should appear first in the
    combined file.

    --tls-client-auth, $TLS_CLIENT_AUTH  (default: none) 
    Policy the server will follow for TLS Client Authentication. Accepted values are
    "none", "request", "require-any", "verify-if-given", or "require-and-verify".

    --tls-client-ca-file, $TLS_CLIENT_CA_FILE 
    PEM-encoded Certificate Authority file used for checking the authenticity of
    client

    --tls-client-cert-file, $TLS_CLIENT_CERT_FILE 
    Path to certificate for client TLS authentication. It requires a PEM-encoded
    file.

    --tls-client-key-file, $TLS_CLIENT_KEY_FILE 
    Path to key for client TLS authentication. It requires a PEM-encoded file.

    --tls-enable, $TLS_ENABLE 
    Whether TLS will be enabled.

    --tls-key-file, $TLS_KEY_FILE 
    Paths to the private keys for each of the certificates. It requires a
    PEM-encoded file.

    --tls-min-version, $TLS_MIN_VERSION  (default: tls12) 
    Minimum supported version of TLS. Accepted values are "tls10", "tls11", "tls12"
    or "tls13"
