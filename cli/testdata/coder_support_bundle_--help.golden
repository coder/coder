coder v0.0.0-devel

USAGE:
  coder support bundle [flags] <workspace> [<agent>]

  Generate a support bundle to troubleshoot issues connecting to a workspace.

  This command generates a file containing detailed troubleshooting information
  about the Coder deployment and workspace connections. You must specify a
  single workspace (and optionally an agent name).

OPTIONS:
  -O, --output-file string, $CODER_SUPPORT_BUNDLE_OUTPUT_FILE
          File path for writing the generated support bundle. Defaults to
          coder-support-$(date +%s).zip.

      --url-override string, $CODER_SUPPORT_BUNDLE_URL_OVERRIDE
          Override the URL to your Coder deployment. This may be useful, for
          example, if you need to troubleshoot a specific Coder replica.

  -y, --yes bool
          Bypass prompts.
