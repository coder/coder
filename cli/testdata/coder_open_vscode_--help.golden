coder v0.0.0-devel

USAGE:
  coder open vscode [flags] <workspace> [<directory in workspace>]

  Open a workspace in VS Code Desktop

OPTIONS:
      --generate-token bool, $CODER_OPEN_VSCODE_GENERATE_TOKEN
          Generate an auth token and include it in the vscode:// URI. This is
          for automagical configuration of VS Code Desktop and not needed if
          already configured. This flag does not need to be specified when
          running this command on a local machine unless automatic open fails.
