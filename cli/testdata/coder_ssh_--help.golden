coder v0.0.0-devel

USAGE:
  coder ssh [flags] <workspace>

  Start a shell into a workspace

OPTIONS:
      --disable-autostart bool, $CODER_SSH_DISABLE_AUTOSTART (default: false)
          Disable starting the workspace automatically when connecting via SSH.

  -A, --forward-agent bool, $CODER_SSH_FORWARD_AGENT
          Specifies whether to forward the SSH agent specified in
          $SSH_AUTH_SOCK.

  -G, --forward-gpg bool, $CODER_SSH_FORWARD_GPG
          Specifies whether to forward the GPG agent. Unsupported on Windows
          workspaces, but supports all clients. Requires gnupg (gpg, gpgconf) on
          both the client and workspace. The GPG agent must already be running
          locally and will not be started for you. If a GPG agent is already
          running in the workspace, it will be attempted to be killed.

      --identity-agent string, $CODER_SSH_IDENTITY_AGENT
          Specifies which identity agent to use (overrides $SSH_AUTH_SOCK),
          forward agent must also be enabled.

  -l, --log-dir string, $CODER_SSH_LOG_DIR
          Specify the directory containing SSH diagnostic log files.

      --no-wait bool, $CODER_SSH_NO_WAIT
          Enter workspace immediately after the agent has connected. This is the
          default if the template has configured the agent startup script
          behavior as non-blocking.
          DEPRECATED: Use --wait instead.

  -R, --remote-forward string, $CODER_SSH_REMOTE_FORWARD
          Enable remote port forwarding (remote_port:local_address:local_port).

      --stdio bool, $CODER_SSH_STDIO
          Specifies whether to emit SSH output over stdin/stdout.

      --wait yes|no|auto, $CODER_SSH_WAIT (default: auto)
          Specifies whether or not to wait for the startup script to finish
          executing. Auto means that the agent startup script behavior
          configured in the workspace template is used.

      --workspace-poll-interval duration, $CODER_WORKSPACE_POLL_INTERVAL (default: 1m)
          Specifies how often to poll for workspace automated shutdown.
