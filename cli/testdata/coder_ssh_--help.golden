Usage: coder ssh [flags] <workspace>

Start a shell into a workspace

[1mOptions[0m
  -A, --forward-agent bool, $CODER_SSH_FORWARD_AGENT
          Specifies whether to forward the SSH agent specified in
          $SSH_AUTH_SOCK.

  -G, --forward-gpg bool, $CODER_SSH_FORWARD_GPG
          Specifies whether to forward the GPG agent. Unsupported on Windows
          workspaces, but supports all clients. Requires gnupg (gpg, gpgconf) on
          both the client and workspace. The GPG agent must already be running
          locally and will not be started for you. If a GPG agent is already
          running in the workspace, it will be attempted to be killed.

      --identity-agent string, $CODER_SSH_IDENTITY_AGENT
          Specifies which identity agent to use (overrides $SSH_AUTH_SOCK),
          forward agent must also be enabled.

      --log-dir string, $CODER_SSH_LOG_DIR (default: /tmp)
          Specify the location for the log files.

  -l, --log-to-file bool, $CODER_SSH_LOG_TO_FILE
          Enable diagnostic logging to file.

      --no-wait bool, $CODER_SSH_NO_WAIT
          Specifies whether to wait for a workspace to become ready before
          logging in (only applicable when the login before ready option has not
          been enabled). Note that the workspace agent may still be in the
          process of executing the startup script and the workspace may be in an
          incomplete state.

      --stdio bool, $CODER_SSH_STDIO
          Specifies whether to emit SSH output over stdin/stdout.

      --workspace-poll-interval duration, $CODER_WORKSPACE_POLL_INTERVAL (default: 1m)
          Specifies how often to poll for workspace automated shutdown.
