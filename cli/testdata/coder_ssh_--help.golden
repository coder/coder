Start a shell into a workspace

Usage:
  coder ssh <workspace> [flags]

Flags:
  -A, --forward-agent                      Specifies whether to forward the SSH agent
                                           specified in $SSH_AUTH_SOCK.
                                           Consumes $CODER_SSH_FORWARD_AGENT
  -G, --forward-gpg                        Specifies whether to forward the GPG agent.
                                           Unsupported on Windows workspaces, but supports all
                                           clients. Requires gnupg (gpg, gpgconf) on both the
                                           client and workspace. The GPG agent must already be
                                           running locally and will not be started for you. If
                                           a GPG agent is already running in the workspace, it
                                           will be attempted to be killed.
                                           Consumes $CODER_SSH_FORWARD_GPG
  -h, --help                               help for ssh
      --identity-agent string              Specifies which identity agent to use (overrides
                                           $SSH_AUTH_SOCK), forward agent must also be
                                           enabled.
                                           Consumes $CODER_SSH_IDENTITY_AGENT
      --no-wait                            Specifies whether to wait for a workspace to become
                                           ready before logging in (only applicable when the
                                           login before ready option has not been enabled).
                                           Note that the workspace agent may still be in the
                                           process of executing the startup script and the
                                           workspace may be in an incomplete state.

      --stdio                              Specifies whether to emit SSH output over

                                           Consumes $CODER_SSH_STDIO
      --workspace-poll-interval duration   Specifies how often to poll for workspace automated
                                           shutdown.
