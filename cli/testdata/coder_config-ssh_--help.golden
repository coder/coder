Usage: coder config-ssh [flags]

Add an SSH Host entry for your workspaces "ssh coder.workspace"

- You can use -o (or --ssh-option) so set SSH options to be used for all your 
    workspaces:                                                                 

     [40m [0m[91;40m$ coder config-ssh -o ForwardAgent=yes[0m[40m [0m

  - You can use --dry-run (or -n) to see the changes that would be made:
